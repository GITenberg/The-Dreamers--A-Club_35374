<h1>THE DREAMERS: A CLUB</h1>

<hr />
<h2>I</h2>

<h3>THE IDEA</h3>

<p>The idea was certainly an original one.
It was Bedford Parke who suggested it
to Tenafly Paterson, and Tenafly was so
pleased with it that he in turn unfolded
it in detail to his friend Dobbs Ferry,
claiming its inception as his very own.
Dobbs was so extremely enthusiastic about
it that he invited Tenafly to a luncheon at
the Waldoria to talk over the possibilities
of putting the plan into practical operation,
and so extract from it whatever of
excellence it might ultimately be found to
contain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As yet it is only an idea, you know,&rdquo;
said Dobbs; &ldquo;and if you have ever had
any experience with ideas, Tenny, you are
probably aware that, unless reduced to a
practical basis, an idea is of no more value
than a theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Tenafly replied. &ldquo;I can demonstrate
that in five minutes at the Waldoria.
For instance, you see, Dobbsy, I
have an idea that I am as hungry as a bear,
but as yet it is only a theory, from which
I derive no substantial benefit. Place a
portion of whitebait, a filet Bearnaise, and
a quart of Sauterne before me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Dobbsy. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="DISCUSSING THE IDEA" title="" />
<span class="caption">DISCUSSING THE IDEA</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>And they went; and the result of that
luncheon at the Waldoria was the formation
of &ldquo;The Dreamers: A Club.&rdquo; The
colon was Dobbs Ferry&rsquo;s suggestion. The
objects of the club were literary, and
Dobbs, who was an observant young man,
had noticed that the use of the colon in
these days of unregenerate punctuation
was confined almost entirely to the literary
contingent and its camp-followers. With
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
small poets particularly was it in vogue,
and Dobbs&mdash;who, by-the-way, had written
some very dainty French poems to the various
<i>fianc&eacute;es</i> with whom his career had
been checkered&mdash;had a sort of vague idea
that if his brokerage business would permit
him to take the necessary time for it he
might become famous as a small poet himself.
The French poems and his passion
for the colon, combined with an exquisite
chirography which he had assiduously cultivated,
all contributed to assure him that
it was only lack of time that kept him in
the ranks of the mute, inglorious Herricks.</p>

<p>As formulated by Dobbs and Tenafly,
then, Bedford Parke&rsquo;s suggestion that a
Dreamers&rsquo; Club be formed was amplified
into this: Thirteen choice spirits, consisting
of Dobbs, Tenafly, Bedford Parke,
Greenwich Place, Hudson Rivers of Hastings,
Monty St. Vincent, Fulton Streete,
Berkeley Hights, Haarlem Bridge, the
three Snobbes of Yonkers&mdash;Tom, Dick,
and Harry&mdash;and Billy Jones of the <i>Weekly
Oracle</i>, were to form themselves into an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
association which should endeavor to extract
whatever latent literary talent the
thirteen members might have within them.
It was a generally accepted fact, Bedford
Parke had said, that all literature, not even
excepting history, was based upon the imagination.
Many of the masterpieces of
fiction had their basis in actual dreams,
and, when they were not founded on such,
might in every case be said to be directly
attributable to what might properly be
called waking dreams. It was the misfortune
of the thirteen gentlemen who were
expected to join this association that the
business and social engagements of all,
with the possible exception of Billy Jones
of the <i>Weekly Oracle</i>, were such as to prevent
their indulgence in these waking
dreams, dreams which should tend to
lower the colors of Howells before those
of Tenafly Paterson, and cause the memory
of Hawthorne to wither away before
the scorching rays of that rising sun of
genius, Tom Snobbe of Yonkers. Snobbe,
by-the-way, must have inherited literary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
ability from his father, who had once
edited a church-fair paper which ran
through six editions in one week&mdash;one
edition a day for each day of the fair&mdash;adding
an unreceipted printer&rsquo;s bill for
eighty-seven dollars to the proceeds to be
divided among the heathen of Central
Africa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a well-known fact,&rdquo; said Bedford&mdash;&ldquo;a
sad fact, but still a fact&mdash;that if Poe
had not been a hard drinker he never would
have amounted to a row of beans as a
writer. His dreams were induced&mdash;and I
say, what&rsquo;s the matter with our inducing
dreams and then putting &rsquo;em down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the scheme in a nutshell&mdash;to
induce dreams and put them down. The
receipt was a simple one. The club was
to meet once a month, and eat and drink
&ldquo;such stuff as dreams are made of&rdquo;; the
meeting was then to adjourn, the members
going immediately home and to bed; the
dreams of each were to be carefully noted
in their every detail, and at the following
meeting were to be unfolded such soul-harrowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
tales as might with propriety
be based thereon. An important part of
the programme was a stenographer, whose
duty it would be to take down the stories
as they were told and put them in type-written
form, which Dobbs was sure he
had heard an editor say was one of the
first steps towards a favorable consideration
by professional readers of the manuscripts
of the ambitious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am told,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that many a
truly meritorious production has gone
unpublished for years because the labor
of deciphering the author&rsquo;s handwriting
proved too much for the reader&rsquo;s endurance&mdash;and
it is very natural that it should
be so. A professional reader is, after all,
only human, and when to the responsibilities
of his office is added the wearisome
task of wading through a Spencerian morass
after the will-o&rsquo;-wisp of an idea, I
don&rsquo;t blame him for getting impatient.
Why, I saw the original manuscript of
one of Charles Dickens&rsquo;s novels once,
and I don&rsquo;t see how any one knew it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
good enough to publish until it got into
print!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simply a proof of what I&rsquo;ve always
said,&rdquo; observed one of the Snobbe
boys. &ldquo;If Charles Dickens&rsquo;s works had
been written by me, no one would ever
have published them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rdquo; returned
Billy Jones of the <i>Oracle</i>, dryly. &ldquo;Why,
Snobbey, my boy, I believe if you had
written the plays of Shakespeare they&rsquo;d
have been forgotten ages ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; returned Snobbe, innocently.
&ldquo;This is a queer world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stenographer will save us a great
deal of trouble,&rdquo; said Bedford. &ldquo;The
hard part of literary work is, after all, the
labor of production in a manual sense.
These real geniuses don&rsquo;t have to think.
Their ideas come to them, and they let
&rsquo;em develop themselves. In realistic writing,
as I understand it, the author sits
down with his pen in his hand and his
characters in his mind&rsquo;s eye, and they
simply run along, and he does the private-detective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
act&mdash;follows after them and jots
down all they do. In imaginative writing
it&rsquo;s done the same way. The characters
of these ridiculous beings we read of are
quite as real to the imaginative writer as
the characters of the realist are to the latter,
and they do supernatural things naturally.
So you see these things require very
little intellectual labor. It&rsquo;s merely the
drudgery of chasing a commonplace or
supernatural set of characters about the
world in order to get 400 pages full of
reading-matter about &rsquo;em that makes the
literary profession a laborious one. Our
stenographer will enable us to avoid all
this. There isn&rsquo;t a man of us but can
talk as easily as he can fall off a log, and
a tale once told at our dinners becomes in
the telling a bit of writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Parke,&rdquo; said Billy Jones
of the <i>Oracle</i>, who had been a &ldquo;literary
journalist,&rdquo; as his fond grandmother called
it, for some years, &ldquo;a story told is hardly
likely to be in the form calculated to become
literature.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we want you for,
Billy,&rdquo; Bedford replied. &ldquo;You know
how to give a thing that last finishing-touch
which will make it go, where otherwise
it might forever remain a fixture in
the author&rsquo;s pigeon-hole. When our stories
are told and type-written, we want you to
go over them, correct the type-writer&rsquo;s
spelling, and make whatever alterations
you may think, after consulting with us,
to be necessary. Then, if the tales are
ever published as a collection, you can have
your name on the title-page as editor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; answered Billy, gratefully.
&ldquo;I shall be charmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he hurried back to his apartments,
and threw himself on his bed in a
paroxysm of laughter which seemed never-ending,
but which in reality did not last
more than three hours at the most.</p>

<p>Hudson Rivers of Hastings, when the
idea was suggested to him, was the most
enthusiastic of all&mdash;so enthusiastic that the
Snobbe boys thought that, in their own
parlance, he ought to be &ldquo;called down.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad form to go crazy over an idea,&rdquo;
they said. &ldquo;If Huddy&rsquo;s going to behave
this way about it, he ought to be kept out
altogether. It is all very well to experience
emotions, but no well-bred person
ever shows them&mdash;that is, not in Yonkers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you don&rsquo;t understand Huddy,&rdquo;
said Tenafly Paterson. &ldquo;Huddy has
two great ambitions in this life. One is
to get into the Authors&rsquo; Club, and the
other is to marry a certain young woman
whose home is in Boston and whose ambitions
are Bostonian. To appear before
the world as a writer, which the Dreamers
will give him a chance to do at small expense,
will help him on to the realization
of his most cherished hopes; in fact,
Huddy told me that he thought we ought
to publish the proceedings of the club at
least four times a year, so establishing a
quarterly magazine, to which we shall all
be regular contributors. He thinks it will
pay for itself, and knows it will make us all
famous, because Billy Jones is certain to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
see that everything that goes out is first
chop, and I&rsquo;m inclined to believe Huddy
is right. The continual drip, drip, drip
of a drop of water on a stone will gradually
wear away the stone, and, by Jove! before
we know it, by constant hammering
away at this dream scheme of ours we&rsquo;ll
gain a position that won&rsquo;t be altogether
unenviable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if with the constant drip, drip,
drip of your drops of ink and inspiration
you could wear the public out in a very
little while. The only troublesome thing
will be in getting a publisher for your
quarterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea that we want a
publisher,&rdquo; said Bedford Parke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got capital enough among ourselves to
bring the thing out, and so I say, what&rsquo;s
the use of letting anybody else in on the
profits? A publisher wouldn&rsquo;t give us
more than ten per cent. in royalties. If
we publish it ourselves we&rsquo;ll get the whole
thing.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Tom Snobbe, &ldquo;and,
what&rsquo;s more, it will have a higher tone to
it if we can say on the title-page &lsquo;Privately
printed,&rsquo; eh? That&rsquo;ll make everybody
in society want one for his library, and
everybody not in society will be crazy to
get it because it&rsquo;s aristocratic all through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; said Billy
Jones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you are right,
only I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d sell more copies if
you&rsquo;d also put on the title-page &lsquo;For circulation
among the &eacute;lite only.&rsquo; Then
every man, woman, or child who happened
to get a copy would take pride in
showing it to others, who would immediately
send for it, because not having it
would seem to indicate that one was not
in the swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor were the others to whom the proposition
was advanced any less desirous to
take part. They saw, one and all, opportunities
for a very desirable distinction
through the medium of the Dreamers,
and within two weeks of the original formation
of the plan the club was definitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
organized. Physicians were consulted
by the various members as to what edibles
contained the properties most likely to
produce dreams of the nature desired, and
at the organization meeting all but Billy
Jones were well stocked with suggestions
for the inauguration dinner. Hudson
Rivers was of the opinion that there
should be six courses at that dinner, each
one of Welsh-rabbit, but varying in form,
such as Welsh-rabbit pur&eacute;e, for instance,
in which the cheese should have the consistency
of pea-soup rather than of leather;
such as Welsh-rabbit p&acirc;t&eacute;, in which
the cheese should rest within walls of
pastry instead of lying quiescent and inviting
like a yellow mantle upon a piece
of toast; then a Welsh-rabbit roast; and
so on all through the banquet, rabbit upon
rabbit, the whole washed down with the
accepted wines of the ordinary banquet,
which experience had taught them were
likely in themselves to assist in the work
of dream-making.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Monty St. Vincent observed that he had
no doubt that the Welsh-rabbit dinner
would work wonders, but he confessed his
inability to see any reason why the club
should begin its labors by committing
suicide. He added that, for his part, he
would not eat six Welsh rabbits at one sitting
if he was sure of Shakespeare&rsquo;s immortality
as his reward, because, however
attractive immortality was, he preferred
mortality in the flesh to the other in the
abstract. If the gentlemen would begin
the meal with a grilled lobster apiece, he
suggested, going thence by an easy stage
to a devilled bird, rounding up with a
&ldquo;slip-on&rdquo;&mdash;which, in brief, is a piece of
mince-pie smothered in a blanket of molten
cheese&mdash;he was ready to take the
plunge, but further than this he would
not go. The other members were disposed
to agree with Monty. They thought
the idea of eating six Welsh rabbits in a
single evening was preposterous, and that
in making such a suggestion Huddy was
inspired by one of but two possible motives&mdash;that
he wished to leap to the foremost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
position in imaginative literature at
one bound, or else was prompted, by jealousy
of what the others might do, to wish
to kill the club at its very start. Huddy
denied these aspersions upon his motives
with vociferous indignation, and to show
his sincerity readily acquiesced in the
adoption of Monty St. Vincent&rsquo;s menu as
already outlined.</p>

<p>The date of the dinner was set, Billy
Jones was made master of ceremonies,
the dinner was ordered, and eaten amid
scenes of such revelry as was possible in
the presence of the Snobbe boys, to whom
anything in the way of unrestrained enjoyment
was a bore and bad form, and at
its conclusion the revellers went straight
home to bed and to dream.</p>

<p>Two weeks later they met again over
viands of a more digestible nature than
those which lent interest to the first dinner,
and told the tales which follow. And
I desire to add here that my report of this
dinner and the literature there produced
is based entirely upon the stenographer&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
notes, coupled with additional information
of an interesting kind furnished me
by my friend William Jones, Esq., Third
Assistant Exchange Editor of <i>The Weekly
Oracle, a Journal of To-day, Yesterday,
and To-morrow</i>.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH THOMAS SNOBBE, ESQ., OF
YONKERS, UNFOLDS A TALE</h3>


<p>The second dinner of the Dreamers had
been served, all but the coffee, when Mr.
Billy Jones, of the <i>Oracle</i>, rapped upon
the table with a dessert-spoon and called
the members to order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, when all was
quiet, &ldquo;we have reached the crucial crisis
of our club career. We have eaten the
stuff of which our dreams were to be
made, and from what I can gather from
the reports of those who are now seated
about this festal board&mdash;and I am delighted
to note that the full membership
of our organization is here represented&mdash;there
is not a single one of you who is unprepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for the work we have in hand,
and, as master of ceremonies, it becomes
my pleasant duty to inform you that the
hour has arrived at which it behooveth us
to begin the narration of those tales which&mdash;of
those tales which I am certain&mdash;yes,
gentlemen, very certain&mdash;will cause the
unlaid ghosts of those masters of the
story-tellers&rsquo; art&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a continued story Billy is giving
us?&rdquo; observed Tenafly Paterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bedford Parke, with a
laugh; &ldquo;it is only a life sentence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get him to commute it!&rdquo; ejaculated
Hudson Rivers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order, gentlemen, order!&rdquo; cried the
master of ceremonies, again rapping upon
the table. &ldquo;The members will kindly
not interrupt the speaker. As I was saying,
gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we are
now to listen to the narration of tales
which I am convinced will cause the unlaid
ghosts of the past grand masters of
the story-tellers&rsquo; art to gnash their spirit
teeth with anguish for that they in life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
failed to realize the opportunities that
were theirs in not having told the tales to
which we are about to listen, and over
which, when published, the leading living
literary lights will writhe in jealousy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the applause which greeted these
remarks had subsided, Mr. Jones resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there may be no question of precedence
among the gifted persons from
whom we are now to hear, I have provided
myself with a small leathern bottle, such
as is to be seen in most billiard-parlors,
within which I have placed twelve numbered
ivory balls. These I will now proceed
to distribute among you. When you
receive them, I request that you immediately
return them to me, that I may arrange
the programme according to your
respective numbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones thereupon distributed the
ivory balls, and when the returns had
been made, according to his request, he
again rose to his feet and announced that
to Mr. Thomas Snobbe, of Yonkers, had
fallen the lot of telling the first story,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
adding that he took great pleasure in the
slightly supererogative task that devolved
upon him of presenting Mr. Snobbe to his
audience. Mr. Snobbe&rsquo;s health was drunk
vociferously, after which, the stenographer
having announced himself as ready to begin,
the distinguished son of Yonkers arose
and told the following story, which he
called</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VAN SQUIBBER&rsquo;S FAILURE</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t always tell what kind of a day
you are going to have in town in October
just because you happen to have been in
town on previous October days, and Van
Squibber, for that reason, was not surprised
when his man, on waking him, informed
him that it was cold out. Even
if he had been surprised he would not
have shown it, for fear of demoralizing
his man by setting him a bad example.
&ldquo;We must take things as they come,&rdquo;
Van Squibber had said to the fellow when
he engaged him, &ldquo;and I shall expect you
to be ready always for any emergency that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
may arise. If on waking in the morning
I call for a camel&rsquo;s-hair shawl and a bottle
of Nepaul pepper, it will be your duty to
see that I get them without manifesting
the slightest surprise or asking any questions.
Here is your next year&rsquo;s salary in
advance. Get my Melton overcoat and
my box, and have them at the Rahway
station at 7.15 to-morrow morning. If
I am not there, don&rsquo;t wait for me, but
come back here and boil my egg at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This small bit of a lecture had had its
effect on the man, to whom thenceforth
nothing was impossible; indeed, upon this
very occasion he demonstrated to his employer
his sterling worth, for when, on
looking over Van Squibber&rsquo;s wardrobe, he
discovered that his master had no Melton
overcoat, he telegraphed to his tailor&rsquo;s
and had one made from his previous measure
in time to have it with Van Squibber&rsquo;s
box at the Rahway station at the stipulated
hour the following morning. Of
course Van Squibber was not there. He
had instructed his man as he had simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to test him, and, furthermore, the egg
was boiled to perfection. The test cost
Van Squibber about $150, but it was successful,
and it was really worth the money
to know that his man was all that he
should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not half bad,&rdquo; said Van Squibber,
as he cracked the egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wintry,&rdquo; said Van Squibber&rsquo;s
man on the morning of the 5th of October.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Van Squibber said, sleepily,
&ldquo;what of that? You have your instructions
as to the bodily temperature I desire
to maintain. Select my clothing, as
usual&mdash;and mark you, man, yesterday was
springy, and you let me go to the club in
summery attire. I was two and a half degrees
too warm. You are getting careless.
What are my engagements to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;University settlement at eleven, luncheon
at the Actors&rsquo; at one, drive with the
cynical Miss Netherwood at three, five-o&rsquo;clock
tea at four&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Van Squibber, sharply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At fuf&mdash;five, I should say, sir,&rdquo; stammered
the embarrassed man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought so,&rdquo; said Van Squibber.
&ldquo;Proceed, and be more careful. The very
idea of five-o&rsquo;clock tea at four is shocking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner with the Austrian ambassador
at eight, opera at eleven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In October? Opera?&rdquo; cried Van
Squibber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comic,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It is Flopper&rsquo;s
last night, sir, and you are to ring
down the curtain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Van Squibber, meditatively&mdash;&ldquo;true;
I&rsquo;d forgotten. And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At midnight you are to meet Red
Mike at Cherry Street and Broadway to
accompany him to see how he robs national
banks, for the <i>Sunday Whirald</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What bank is it to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Seventeenth National.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; cried Van Squibber, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
hard luck. It&rsquo;s my bank. Wire Red Mike
and ask him to make it the Sixteenth National,
at once. Bring me my smoking-jacket
and a boiled soda mint drop. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t care for any breakfast this morning.
And, by-the-way, I feel a little chilly.
Take a quinine pill for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your egg is ready, sir,&rdquo; said the man,
tremulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat it,&rdquo; said Van Squibber, tersely,
&ldquo;and deduct the Caf&eacute; Savarin price of a
boiled egg from your salary. How often
must I tell you not to have my breakfast
boiled until I am boil&mdash;I mean ready until
I am ready for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man departed silently, and Van
Squibber turned over and went to sleep.</p>

<p>An hour later, having waited for his
soda mint drop as long as his dignity would
permit, Van Squibber arose and dressed
and went for a walk in Central Park. It
was eccentric of him to do this, but he did
it nevertheless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How Travers would laugh if he saw
me walking in Central Park!&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d probably ask me when I&rsquo;d come over
from Germany,&rdquo; he added. And then,
looking ahead, a thing Van Squibber rarely
did, by-the-way&mdash;for you can&rsquo;t always tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
by looking ahead what may happen to
you&mdash;his eyes were confronted by a more
or less familiar back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t
Eleanor Huyler&rsquo;s back, whose back is it,
by Jove?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Insensibly Van Squibber quickened his
pace. This was also a thing he rarely did.
&ldquo;Haste is bad form,&rdquo; he had once said to
Travers, who, on leaving Delmonico&rsquo;s at
7.20, seemed anxious to catch the 7.10
train for Riverdale. Insensibly quickening
his pace, he soon found himself beside
the owner of the back, and, as his premonitions
had told him, it was Eleanor
Huyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Van Squibber!&rdquo; she replied,
with a terrified smile. &ldquo;You here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Van Squibber, not
anxious to commit himself, &ldquo;I think so,
though I assure you, Miss Huyler, I am
not at all certain. I seem to be here, but
I must confess I am not quite myself this
morning. My man&mdash;&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know,&rdquo; returned the girl,
hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him. He is your
<i>alter ego</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not noticed it,&rdquo; said Van Squibber,
somewhat nonplussed. &ldquo;I think he
is English, though he may be Italian, as
you suggest. But,&rdquo; he added, to change
the subject, &ldquo;you seem disturbed. Your
smile is a terrified smile, as has been already
noted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Miss Huyler, looking anxiously
about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may I ask why?&rdquo; asked Van
Squibber, politely&mdash;for to do things politely
was Van Squibber&rsquo;s ambition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, really, Mr. Van Squibber,&rdquo;
the girl replied, &ldquo;I am always anxious
when you are about. The fact is, you
know, the things that happen when you
are around are always so very extraordinary.
I came here for a quiet walk, but
now that you have appeared I am quite
certain that something dramatic is about
to occur. You see&mdash;you&mdash;you have turned
up so often at the&mdash;what I may properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
call, I think, the nick of time, and so rarely
at any other time, that I feel as though
some disaster were impending which you
alone can avert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo; said Van Squibber,
proudly. &ldquo;If I am here, what bodes disaster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the question I am asking myself,&rdquo;
returned Miss Huyler, whose growing
anxiety was more or less painful to
witness. &ldquo;Can your luck hold out?
Will your ability as an averter of danger
hold out? In short, Mr. Van Squibber,
are you infallible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question came to Van Squibber like
a flash of lightning out of a clear sky.
It was too pertinent. Had he not often
wondered himself as to his infallibility?
Had he not only the day before said to
Travers, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t always tell in advance
just how a thing you are going into
may turn out, even though you have been
through that thing many times, and think
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do lead a dramatic life,&rdquo; he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
quietly, hoping by a show of serenity to
reassure her. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, proudly,
&ldquo;I am, after all, Van Squibber; I am here
to do whatever is sent me to do. I am
not a fatalist, but I regard myself as the
chosen instrument of fate&mdash;or something.
So far, I have not failed. On the basis of
averages, I am not likely to fail now. Fate,
or something, has chosen me to succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Eleanor&mdash;&ldquo;quite
true; but there are exceptions to all rules,
and I would rather you would fail to rescue
some other girl from a position of peril
than myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Miss Huyler&rsquo;s words were prophetic,
the unhappy Van Squibber was to
realize, and that soon, for almost as they
spoke the cheeks of both were blanched
by a dreadful roar in the bushes beside
the path upon which they walked.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I leave you?&rdquo; asked Van Squibber,
politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now&mdash;oh, not now, I beg!&rdquo; cried
Miss Huyler. &ldquo;It is too late. The
catastrophe is imminent. You should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
have gone before the author brought it on.
Finding me defenceless and you gone, he
might have spared me. As it is, you are
here, and must fulfil your destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Van Squibber.
&ldquo;That being so, I will see what this roaring
is. If it is a child endeavoring to
frighten you, I shall get his address and
have my man chastise his father, for I
could never strike a child; but if it is a
lion, as I fear, I shall do what seems best
under the circumstances. I have been
told, Miss Huyler, that a show of bravery
awes a wild beast, while a manifestation
of cowardice causes him to spring at once
upon the coward. Therefore, if it be a
lion, do you walk boldly up to him and
evince a cool head, while I divert his attention
from you by running away. In
this way you, at least, will be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble fellow!&rdquo; thought Eleanor to
herself. &ldquo;If he were to ask me, I think
I might marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Van Squibber had investigated,
and was horror-struck to find his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
misgivings entirely too well founded. It
was the lion from the park menagerie that
had escaped, and was now waiting in ambush
to pounce upon the chance pedestrian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, Eleanor,&rdquo; he cried, forgetting
for the moment that he had never
called her by any but her last name with
its formal prefix&mdash;&ldquo;remember to be brave.
That will awe him, and then when he sees
me running he will pursue me.&rdquo;</p>

with a cry which brought the hungry
beast bounding out into the path, started
on a dead run, while Miss Huyler, full of
confidence that the story would end happily
whatever she might do, walked boldly
up to the tawny creature, wondering much,
however, why her rescuer had removed his
shoes. It was strange that, knowing Van
Squibber as well as she did, she did not at
once perceive his motive in declining to
run in walking-shoes, but in moments of
peril we are all excusable for our vagaries
of thought! You never can tell, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
you are in danger, what may happen next,
for if you could you would know how it
is all going to turn out; but as it is, mental
disturbance is quite to be expected.</p>

<p>For once Van Squibber failed. He ran
fast enough and betrayed enough cowardice
to attract the attention of ten lions,
but this special lion, by some fearful idiosyncrasy
of fate, which you never can
count on, was not to be deceived. With
a louder roar than any he had given, he
pounced upon the brave woman, and in
an instant she was no more. Van Squibber,
turning to see how matters stood,
was just in time to witness the final engulfment
of the fair girl in the lion&rsquo;s
jaws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;<i>I have failed!</i>
And now what remains to be done? Shall
I return and fight the lion, or shall I keep
on and go to the club? If I kill the lion,
people will know that I have been walking
in the park before breakfast. If I
continue my present path and go to the
club, the fellows will all want to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
what I mean by coming without my shoes
on. What a dilemma! Ah! I have it;
I will go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that is what Van Squibber did.
He went back to his rooms in the Quigmore
at once, hastily undressed, and when,
an hour later, his man returned with the
soda mint drop, he was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>That night he met Travers at the club
reading the <i>Evening Moon</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Van!&rdquo; said Travers. &ldquo;Heard
the news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo; asked Van Squibber,
languidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleanor Huyler has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Van Squibber, with
well-feigned surprise. &ldquo;I heard the boys
crying &lsquo;Extra,&rsquo; but I never dreamed they
would put out an extra for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Travers. &ldquo;The
extra&rsquo;s about the lion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! And what&rsquo;s happened to the
lion?&rdquo; cried Van Squibber, nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead. Got loose this morning
early, and was found at ten o&rsquo;clock dying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of indigestion. It is supposed he has devoured
some man, name unknown, for
before his nose was an uneaten patent-leather
pump, size 9&frac34; B, and in his throat
was stuck the other, half eaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; muttered Van Squibber, turning
pale. &ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t know whose shoes
they were?&rdquo; he added, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Travers. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no clew,
even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Van Squibber breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; he cried, addressing the
waiter, &ldquo;bring me a schooner of absinthe,
and ask Mr. Travers what he&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;
And then, turning, he said, <i>sotto voce</i>, to
himself, &ldquo;Saved! And Eleanor is revenged.
Van Squibber may have failed,
but his patent-leather pumps have conquered.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IN WHICH A MINCE-PIE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE</h3>


<p>When Mr. Snobbe sat down after the
narration of his story, there was a thunderous
outburst of applause. It was evident
that the exciting narrative had pleased
his fellow-diners very much&mdash;as, indeed,
it was proper that it should, since it dealt
in a veiled sort of way with characters
for whom all right-minded persons
have not only a deep-seated admiration,
but a feeling of affection as well. They
had, one and all, in common with the unaffected
portion of the reading community,
a liking for the wholesome and clean
humor of Mr. Van Bibber, and the fact
that Snobbe&rsquo;s story suggested a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
original, even in a weak sort of fashion,
made them like it in spite of its shortcomings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work,&rdquo; cried Hudson Rivers.
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s only gas in comparison
with the sun, but it gives light, and we
like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s wholly original, too, even
though an imitation in manner. The real
Van Bibber never failed in anything he
undertook,&rdquo; said Tenafly Paterson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
often wished he might have, just once&mdash;it
would have made him seem more human&mdash;and
for that reason I think Tom is entitled
to praise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; observed
Monty St. Vincent. &ldquo;Tom hadn&rsquo;t anything
to do with it&mdash;it was the dinner.
Honor to whom honor is due, say I. Praise
the cook, or the caterer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; put in Billie Jones.
&ldquo;Fact is, when this book of ours comes
out, I think, instead of putting our names
on the title-page as authors, the thing to
do is to print the menu.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You miss the point of this association,&rdquo;
interjected Snobbe. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
banded ourselves together to immortalize
a Welsh rabbit or a mince-pie&mdash;nay, nor
even a ruddy duck. It&rsquo;s our own glory
we&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; cried Monty St. Vincent&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the beauty of it. The scheme
works two ways. If the stuff is good and
there is glory in it, we&rsquo;ll have the glory;
but if it&rsquo;s bad, we&rsquo;ll blame the dinner.
That&rsquo;s what I like about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a valuable plan from that point
of view,&rdquo; said the presiding officer. &ldquo;And
now, if the gentleman who secured the
ball numbered two will make himself
known, we will proceed.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Hudson Rivers rose up. &ldquo;I have number
two,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have nothing
to relate. The coffee I drank kept me
awake all night, and when I finally slept,
along about six o&rsquo;clock next morning, it
was one of those sweet, dreamless sleeps
that we all love so much. I must therefore
ask to be excused.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But how shall you be represented in
the book?&rdquo; asked Mr. Harry Snobbe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can do the table of contents,&rdquo; suggested
St. Vincent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or the fly-leaves,&rdquo; said Tenafly Paterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Huddy; &ldquo;I shall ask that
the pages I should have filled be left blank.
There is nothing helps a book so much as
the leaving of something to the reader&rsquo;s
imagination. I heard a great critic say so
once. He said that was the strong point
of the French writers, and he added that
Stockton&rsquo;s <i>Lady or the Tiger</i> took hold because
Stockton didn&rsquo;t insist on telling
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know but that if those pages are left
blank they&rsquo;ll be the most interesting in
the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers sat down with a smile of
conscious pride, whereupon Mr. Tenafly
Paterson rose up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I hold the number three ball, I
will give you the fruits of my dinner. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
attribute the work which I am about to
present to you to the mince-pie. Personally,
I am a great admirer of certain latter-day
poets who deal with the woes and joys
of more or less commonplace persons. I
myself would rather read a sonnet to a
snow-shovel than an ode to the moon,
but in my dream I seem to have conceived
a violent hatred for authors of
homely verse, as you will note when I
have finished reading my dream-poem
called &lsquo;Retribution.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; murmured Billie Jones,
with a deep-drawn sigh. &ldquo;Poetry! From
Tenafly Paterson! Of all the afflictions of
man, Job could have known no worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The poem reads as follows,&rdquo; continued
Paterson, ignoring the chairman&rsquo;s ill-timed
remark:</p>


<h4>RETRIBUTION</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Writ a pome about a kid.<br />
Finest one I ever did.<br />
<br />
Heaped it full o&rsquo; sentiment&mdash;<br />
Very best I could invent.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<br />
Talked about his little toys;<br />
How he played with other boys;<br />
<br />
How the beasts an&rsquo; birdies all<br />
Come when little Jamie&rsquo;d call.<br />
<br />
&rsquo;N&rsquo; &rsquo;en I took that little lad,<br />
Gave him fever, mighty bad.<br />
<br />
&rsquo;N&rsquo; &rsquo;en it sorter pleased my whim<br />
To have him die and bury him.<br />
<br />
It got printed, too, it did<br />
That small pome about the kid,<br />
<br />
In a paper in the West;<br />
Put ten dollars in my vest.<br />
<br />
Every pa an&rsquo; ma about<br />
Cried like mighty&mdash;cried right out.<br />
<br />
I jess took each grandma&rsquo;s heart,<br />
Lammed and bruised it, made it smart;<br />
<br />
&rsquo;N&rsquo; everybody said o&rsquo; me,<br />
&ldquo;Finest pote we ever see,&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&rsquo;Cept one beggar, he got mad.<br />
Got worst lickin&rsquo; ever had;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><br />
Got my head atween his fists,<br />
Called me &ldquo;Prince o&rsquo; anarchists.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Clipped me one behind my ear&mdash;<br />
Laid me up for &rsquo;most a year.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my poetry<br />
&rsquo;D made his wife an&rsquo; mother cry;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twarn&rsquo;t no poet&rsquo;s bizness to<br />
Make the wimmin all boo-hoo.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&rsquo;N&rsquo; &rsquo;at is why to-day, by Jings!<br />
I don&rsquo;t fool with hearts an&rsquo; things.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t care how high the bids,<br />
I&rsquo;ve stopped scribblin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout dead kids;<br />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The lines were received with hearty appreciation
by all save Dobbs Ferry, who
looked a trifle gloomy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing,&rdquo; said the latter,
&ldquo;but that mince-pie affected me in precisely
the same way, as you will see for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
yourselves when I read my contribution,
which, holding ball number four as I do,
I will proceed to give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ferry then read the following poem,
which certainly did seem to indicate that
the man who prepared the fatal pie had
certain literary ideas which he mixed in
with other ingredients:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
I bought a book of verse the other day,<br />
And when I read, it filled me with dismay.<br />
<br />
I wanted it to take home to my wife,<br />
To bring a bit of joy into her life;<br />
<br />
And I&rsquo;d been told the author of those pomes<br />
Was called the laureate of simple homes.<br />
<br />
But, Jove! I read, and found it full of rhyme<br />
That kept my eyes a-filling all the time.<br />
<br />
One told about a pretty little miss<br />
Whose father had denied a simple kiss,<br />
<br />
And as she left, unhappy, full of cares,<br />
She fell and broke her neck upon the stairs.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span><br />
And then he wrote a lot of tearful lines<br />
Of children who had trouble with their spines;<br />
<br />
And &rsquo;stead of joys, he penned so many woes<br />
I sought him out and gave him curvature &rsquo;f the nose;<br />
<br />
And all the nation, witnessing his plight,<br />
Did crown me King, and cry, &ldquo;It served him right.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;A remarkable coincidence,&rdquo; said
Thomas Snobbe. &ldquo;In fact, the coincidence
is rather more remarkable than
the poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; said Billie Jones;
&ldquo;but what a wonderfully suggestive pie,
considering that it was a mince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After which dictum the presiding officer
called upon the holder of the fifth ball,
who turned out to be none other than
Bedford Parke, who blushingly rose up
and delivered himself of what he called
&ldquo;The Overcoat, a Magazine Farce.&rdquo;</p>

<i>Time</i>: <span class="smcap">Morning at Boston</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I think it will
rain to-day, but there is no need to worry
about that. Robert has his umbrella and
his mackintosh, and I don&rsquo;t think he is
idiotic enough to lend both of them. If
he does, he&rsquo;ll get wet, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Mrs.
Edwards is speaking to herself in the sewing-room
of the apartment occupied by
herself and her husband in the Hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Hammingbell at Boston. It is not a large
room, but cosey. A frieze one foot deep
runs about the ceiling, and there is a
carpet on the floor. Three pins are seen
scattered about the room, in one corner
of which is a cane-bottomed chair holding
across its back two black vests and a cutaway
coat. Mrs. Edwards sits before a
Wilcox &amp; Wilson sewing-machine sewing
a button on a light spring overcoat.
The overcoat has one outside and three
inside pockets, and is single-breasted. &ldquo;It
is curious,&rdquo; Mrs. Edwards continues,
&ldquo;what men will do with umbrellas and
mackintoshes on a rainy day. They lend
them here and there, and the worst part
of it is they never remember where.&rdquo; A
knock is heard at the door. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Voice</i> (<i>without</i>). &ldquo;Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards</i> (<i>with a nervous
shudder</i>). &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Enter Mary the
house-maid. She is becomingly attired in
blue alpaca, with green ribbons and puffed
sleeves. She holds a feather duster in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
her right hand, and in her left is a jar of
Royal Worcester. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; Mrs. Edwards
says, severely, &ldquo;where are we at?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> (<i>meekly</i>). &ldquo;Boston, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;South Boston
or Boston proper?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;Boston proper, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Then when I
say &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Me.&rsquo; That
manner of speaking may do at New York,
Brooklyn, South Boston, or Congress, but
at Boston proper it is extremely gauche.
&lsquo;I&rsquo; is the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; but you know,
ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t pretend to be literary,
ma&rsquo;am, and so these little points baffles I
very often.&rdquo; Mrs. Edwards sighs, and,
walking over to the window, looks out
upon the trolley-cars for ten minutes;
then, picking up one of the pins from the
floor and putting it in a pink silk pin-cushion
which stands next to an alarm-clock
on the mantel-piece, a marble affair
with plain caryatids and a brass fender
around the hearth, she resumes her seat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
before the sewing-machine, and threads a
needle. Then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Well, Mary,
what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;Please, Mrs. Edwards, the
butcher is came, and he says they have
some very fine perairie-chickens to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
any prairie-chickens. The prairies are so
very vulgar. Tell him never to suggest
such a thing again. Have we any potatoes
in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s three left, ma&rsquo;am, and
two slices of cold roast beef.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Then tell him
to bring five more potatoes, a steak, and&mdash;Was
all the pickled salmon eaten?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;All but the can, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Well&mdash;Mr. Edwards
is very fond of fish. Tell him to
bring two boxes of sardines and a bottle
of anchovy paste.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;Very well, Mrs. Edwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;And&mdash;ah&mdash;Mary,
tell him to bring some Brussels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sprouts for breakfast. What are you doing
with that Worcester vase?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;I was takin&rsquo; it to cook, ma&rsquo;am.
Sure she broke the bean-pot this mornin&rsquo;,
and she wanted somethin&rsquo; to cook the
beans in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Robert Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Oh, I see.
Well, take good care of it, Mary. It&rsquo;s a
rare piece. In fact, I think you&rsquo;d better
leave that here and remove the rubber
plant from the jardini&egrave;re, and let Nora
cook the beans in that. Times are a little
too hard to cook beans in Royal Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> &ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Mary goes
out through the door. Mrs. Edwards resumes
her sewing. Fifteen minutes elapse,
interrupted only by the ticking of the
alarm-clock and the occasional ringing of
the bell on passing trolley-cars. &ldquo;If it
does rain,&rdquo; Mrs. Edwards says at last,
with an anxious glance through the window,
&ldquo;I suppose Robert won&rsquo;t care about
going to see the pantomime to-night. It
will be too bad if we don&rsquo;t go, for this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the last night of the season, and I&rsquo;ve been
very anxious to renew my acquaintance
with &lsquo;Humpty Dumpty.&rsquo; It is so very
dramatic, and I do so like dramatic
things. Even when they happen in my
own life I like dramatic things. I&rsquo;ll
never forget how I enjoyed the thrill
that came over me, even in my terror, that
night last winter when the trolley-car
broke down in front of this house; and
last summer, too, when the oar-lock broke
in our row-boat thirty-three feet from
shore; that was a situation that I enjoyed
in spite of its peril. How people can say
that life is humdrum, I can&rsquo;t see. Exciting
things, real third-act situations, climaxes
I might even call them, are always
happening in my life, and yet some novelists
pretend that life is humdrum just to
excuse their books for being humdrum.
I&rsquo;d just like to show these apostles of realism
the diary I could have kept if I had
wanted to. Beginning with the fall my
brother George had from the hay-wagon,
back in 1876, running down through my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
first meeting with Robert, which was romantic
enough&mdash;he paid my car-fare in
from Brookline the day I lost my pocket-book&mdash;even
to yesterday, when an entire
stranger called me up on the telephone,
my life has fairly bubbled with dramatic
situations that would take the humdrum
theory and utterly annihilate it.&rdquo; As Mrs.
Edwards is speaking she is also sewing the
button already alluded to on Mr. Edwards&rsquo;s
coat as described. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; taking the last
stitch in the coat, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s done, and now
I can go and get ready for luncheon.&rdquo; She
folds up the coat, glances at the clock,
and goes out. A half-hour elapses. The
silence is broken only by occasional noises
from the street, the rattling of the wheels
of a herdic over the pavement, the voices
of newsboys, and an occasional strawberry-vender&rsquo;s
cry. At the end of the
half-hour the alarm-clock goes off and the
curtain falls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">SCENE SECOND<br /><br />

<i>Time</i>: <span class="smcap">Evening at Boston</span></p>

<p>The scene is laid in the drawing-room
of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Edwards. Mrs.
Edwards is discovered reading <i>Pendennis</i>,
and seems in imminent danger of going to
sleep over it. Mr. Edwards is stretched
out upon the sofa, quite asleep, with <i>Ivanhoe</i>
lying open upon his chest. Twenty-five
minutes elapse, when the door-bell
rings.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards</i> (<i>drowsily</i>). &ldquo;Let me off
at the next corner, conductor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Why, Robert&mdash;what

<p><i>Mr. Edwards</i> (<i>rubbing his eyes and sitting
up</i>). &ldquo;Eh? What? Nonsense? I
talk nonsense? Really, my dear, that is
a serious charge to bring against one of
the leading characters in a magazine farce.
Wit, perhaps, I may indulge in, but nonsense,
never!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;That is precisely what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I complain about. The idea of a well-established
personage like yourself lying
off on a sofa in his own apartment and
asking a conductor to let him off at the
next corner! It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything
of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;You did, too, Robert
Edwards. And I can prove it. If you
will read back to the opening lines of this
scene you will find that I have spoken the
truth&mdash;unless you forgot your lines. If
you admit that, I have nothing to say,
but I will add that if you are going to forget
lines that give the key-note of the
whole situation, you&rsquo;ve got no business in
a farce. You&rsquo;ll make the whole thing fall
flat some day, and then you will be discharged.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Well, I wish I might
be discharged; I&rsquo;m tired of the whole
business. Anybody&rsquo;d take me for an
idiot, the way I have to go on. Every bit
of fun there is to be had in these farces is
based upon some predicament into which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
my idiocy or yours gets me. Are we
idiots? I ask you that. Are we? You
may be, but, Mrs. Edwards, I am not. The
idea of my falling asleep over <i>Ivanhoe</i>!
Would I do that if I had my way? Well,
I guess not! Would I even dare to say
&lsquo;I guess not&rsquo; in a magazine farce? Again,
I guess not. I&rsquo;m going to write to the
editor this very night, and resign my situation.
I want to be me. I don&rsquo;t want
to be what some author thinks I ought to
be. Do you know what I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards</i> (<i>warningly</i>). &ldquo;Take care,
Robert. Take care. You aren&rsquo;t employed
to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Precisely. That&rsquo;s what
makes me so immortally mad. The author
doesn&rsquo;t give me time to think. I could
think real thoughts if he&rsquo;d let me, but
then! The curtain wouldn&rsquo;t stay up half
a second if I did that; and where would
the farce be? The audience would go
home tired, because they wouldn&rsquo;t get
their nap if the curtain was down. It&rsquo;s
hard luck; and as for me, I wouldn&rsquo;t keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the position a minute if I could get anything
else to do. Nobody&rsquo;d give me work,
now that I&rsquo;ve been made out to be such
a confounded jackass. But let&rsquo;s talk of
other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, Robert&mdash;but
we can&rsquo;t. There are no other
things in the farce. The Billises are
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Hang the Billises!
Can&rsquo;t we ever have an evening to ourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;How you do talk!
How can we? There&rsquo;s got to be some
action in the farce, and it&rsquo;s the Billis
family that draws out our peculiarities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going out,
and you can receive the Billises, and if it&rsquo;s
necessary for me to say anything to give
go to the play, you can say it. I make you
my proxy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done, Robert.
They are here. The bell rang ten
minutes ago, and they ought to have got
in here five minutes since. You can&rsquo;t go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
out without meeting them in the wings&mdash;I
mean the hallway.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Billis</span>.</p>

<p><i>Billis.</i> &ldquo;Ah, Edwards! Howdy do?
Knew you were home. Saw light in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Billis.</i> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rattle on so, my
dear. Speak more slowly, or the farce will
be over before nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Billis.</i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to say my lines, and
I&rsquo;m going to say them my way. Ah,
Edwards! Howdy do? Knew you were
home. Saw light in window. Knew your
economical spirit. Said to myself must be
home, else why gas? He doesn&rsquo;t burn
gas when he&rsquo;s out. Wake up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asleep. Fact
is, I am going out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Billis.</i> &ldquo;Out?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Robert!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said&mdash;out.
<i>O-u-t.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Billis.</i> &ldquo;Not bad idea. Go with you.
Where to?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Anywhere&mdash;to find a
tragedy and take part in it. I&rsquo;m done
farcing, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Billis</i> (<i>slapping</i> Edwards <i>on back</i>).
&ldquo;Rah! my position exactly. I&rsquo;m sick of
it too. Come ahead. I know that fellow
Whoyt&mdash;he&rsquo;ll take us in and give us a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Billis.</i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been afraid of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Robert, consider your
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I have; and if I&rsquo;m to
die respected and honored, if my family
is to have any regard for my memory,
I&rsquo;ve got to get out of farcing. That&rsquo;s all.
Did you sew the button on my overcoat?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I did. I&rsquo;ll go get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She goes out. Mrs. Billis throws herself
sobbing on sofa. Billis dances a jig. Forty
minutes elapse, during which Billis&rsquo;s dance
may be encored. Enter Mrs. Edwards,
triumphantly, with overcoat.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your overcoat.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;But&mdash;but the button
isn&rsquo;t sewed on. I can&rsquo;t go out in this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;I knew it, Robert. I
sewed the button on the wrong coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billis and Robert fall in a faint. Mrs.
Billis rises and smiles, grasping Mrs. Edwards&rsquo;s
hand fervently.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Billis.</i> &ldquo;Noble woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Edwards.</i> &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve saved the
farce.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Billis.</i> &ldquo;You have. For, in spite
of these&mdash;these strikers&mdash;these theatric
Debses, you&mdash;you got in the point! <i>The
button was sewed on the wrong overcoat!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width:30%' />

<p>&ldquo;When the farce was finished,&rdquo; said
Mr. Parke, &ldquo;and the applause which
greeted the fall of the curtain had subsided,
I dreamed also the following author&rsquo;s
note: &lsquo;The elapses&rsquo; in this farce
may seem rather long, but the reader must
remember that it is the author&rsquo;s intention
that his farce, if acted, should last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
throughout a whole evening. If it were
not for the elapses the acting time would
be scarcely longer than twenty minutes,
instead of two hours and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mention this,&rdquo; Mr. Parke added,
&ldquo;not only in justification of myself, but
also as a possible explanation of certain
shortcomings in the work of the original
master. Sometimes the action may seem
to drag a trifle, but that is not the fault
of the author, but of life itself. To be real
one must be true, and truth is not to be
governed by him who holds the pen.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width:30%' />

<p>Mr. Parke&rsquo;s explanation having been received
in a proper and appreciative spirit
by his fellow-Dreamers, Mr. Jones announced
that Mr. Monty St. Vincent was
the holder of the sixth ball, whereupon
Mr. St. Vincent arose and delivered himself
as follows:</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<h2>V</h2>

<h3>THE SALVATION OF FINDLAYSON</h3>


<p class="center"><i>Being the story told by the holder of the sixth ball,
Mr. Monty St. Vincent.</i></p>


<p>A donkey engine, next to a Sophomore
at a football match that is going his
way, is the noisiest thing man ever made,
and No. 4-11-44, who travelled first-class on
the American liner <i>New York</i>, was not inclined
to let anybody forget the fact.
He held a commanding position on the
roof of the deck state-room No. 10, just
aft of the forecastle stringer No. 3, and
over the main jib-stay boom No. 6<small><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small>, that
held the rudder-chains in place. All the
little Taffrails and Swashbucklers looked
up to him, and the Capstan loved him like
a brother, for he very often helped the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Capstan to bring the Anchor aboard, when
otherwise that dissipated bit of iron would
have staid out all night. The Port Tarpaulins
insisted that the Donkey Engine
was the greatest humorist that ever lived,
although the Life Preservers hanging by
the rail did not like him at all, because he
once said they were Irish&mdash;&ldquo;Cork all
through,&rdquo; said he. Even the Rivets that
held the Top Gallant Bilges together used
to strain their eyes to see the points of
the Donkey Engine&rsquo;s jokes, and the third
Deputy-assistant Piston Rod, No. 683, in
the hatchway stoke-hole, used to pound
the cylinders almost to pieces trying to
encore the Donkey Engine&rsquo;s comic songs.</p>

<p>The Main Mast used to say that the
Donkey Engine was as bright as the Starboard
Lights, and the Smoke Stack is
said to have told the Safety Valve that
he&rsquo;d rather give up smoking than lose
the constant flow of wit the Donkey Engine
was always giving forth.</p>

<p>Findlayson discovered all this. After
his Bridge had gone safely through that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
terrible ordeal when the Ganges rose and
struck for higher tides, Findlayson collapsed.
The Bridge&mdash;But that is another
story. This is this one, and there
is little profit in telling two stories at once,
especially in a day when one can get the
two stories printed separately in the several
magazines for which one writes exclusively.</p>

<p>After the ordeal of the Kashi Bridge,
Findlayson, as I have said, collapsed, and
it is no wonder, as you will see for yourself
when you read that other story. As
the Main Girder of the Bridge itself wrote
later to the Suspension Cables of the Brooklyn
Bridge, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder to me that the
Sahib didn&rsquo;t have the <i>Bashi-bazouks</i> earlier
in the game. He suffered a terrible strain
that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which the Cables of the Brooklyn
Bridge wittily replied that while they
sympathized with Findlayson, they didn&rsquo;t
believe he really knew what strain was.
&ldquo;Wait until he has five lines of trolley-cars
running over him all day and night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
That <i>is</i> a strain! He&rsquo;d be worse cut up
than ever if he had that. And yet we
thrive under it. After all, for solid health,
it&rsquo;s better to be a Bridge than a Man.
When are you coming across?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Findlayson might have collapsed
a dozen times before the Government
would have cared enough to give him the
vacation he needed. Not that Government
is callous, like an elephant, but because
it is conducted, as a witty Cobra
once remarked in the jungle as he fascinated
a Tigress, by a lot of Red Tapirs.
Findlayson put in an application for a six
months&rsquo; vacation, but by the time the
necessary consent had reached him the
six months were up. Everybody remembers
the tale of Dorkins of the Welsh
Fusileers and his appointment to the Department
of the Poloese, how his term of
office was to be six years, and how by the
time his credentials reached him his term
of office had expired. So with Findlayson.
On the very date of the expiration
of his desired leave he received permission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to go, and of course could not then do
so, because it was too late. Fortunately
for Findlayson, however, the Viceroy himself
happened to be passing through, and
Findlayson entertained him at a luncheon
on the Bridge. By some curious mistake,
when the nuts and raisins were passed,
Findlayson had provided a plateful of
steel nuts, designed to hold rivets in
place, instead of the usual assortment of
almonds and <i>hiki-ree</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man needs a rest,&rdquo; said the Viceroy,
as he broke his front tooth trying to
crack one of the steel nuts, and he immediately
extended Findlayson&rsquo;s leave to
twenty years without pay, for which Findlayson
was very grateful.</p>

<span class="caption">THE VICEROY EXAMINES HIS RUINED SMILE</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the man?&rdquo;
asked the Viceroy, as he drove to the station
with the practising Jinrikshaw of the
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my professional opinion,&rdquo; replied
the Jinrikshaw, &ldquo;that the Sahib has a
bad attack of melancholia. He hasn&rsquo;t
laughed for six months. If we could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
only get him to laugh, I think he&rsquo;d recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was not in a jocular spirit
that he ruined my teeth with those nuts?&rdquo;
demanded the Viceroy, taking a small
mirror out of his pocket and gazing ruefully
on his ruined smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your most Excellent Excellency,&rdquo;
replied the Jinrikshaw. &ldquo;The fact that
he ate five of them himself shows that it
was an error, not a jest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was thus that Findlayson got his vacation,
and even to this day the Kaskalooloo
folk are laughing over his error
more heartily than they ever laughed
over a joke.</p>

<p>A month after leaving his post Findlayson
reached London, where he was
placed under the care of the most famous
physicians. They did everything they
could to make him laugh, without success.
<i>Punch</i> was furnished, and he read
it through day after day, and burst into
hysterical weeping. They took him to
the theatres, and he never even smiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
They secured a front seat in the House of
Commons for him during important debates,
and he merely sobbed. They took
him to the Army and Navy Stores, and he
shivered with fear. Even Beerbohm Tree
as Lady Macbeth, or whatever r&ocirc;le it was
he was playing at the time, failed to coax
the old-time dimple to his cheek. His
friends began to whisper among themselves
that &ldquo;old Findlayson was done
for,&rdquo; when Berkeley Hauksbee, who had
been with him in the Soudan, suggested a
voyage to the United States.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see enough there to laugh at,
or I&rsquo;m an unshod, unbroken, saw-backed,
shark-eating skate!&rdquo; he asserted, and as a
last resource Findlayson was packed, bag
and baggage, aboard the liner <i>New York</i>.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THEY GAVE HIM PUNCH</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The first three days out Findlayson was
dead to the world. He lay like a fallen
log in the primeval forest. Stewards
were of no avail. Even the repeated calls
of the doctor, whose apprehensions were
aroused, could not restore him to life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be sewin&rsquo; him up in a jute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
bag and droppin&rsquo; him overboard if he
doesn&rsquo;t come to by to-morrow,&rdquo; observed
the Water Bottle to the Soap Dish, with
a sympathetic glance at the prostrate
Findlayson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be seasicker than ever if they
do,&rdquo; returned the Soap Dish. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long
swim from here to Sandy Hook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Findlayson came to in time to
avert the catastrophe, and took several
turns up and down the deck. He played
horse-billiards with an English curate,
but showed no sign of interest or amusement
even at the curious aspect of the
ladies who lay inert in the steamer chairs
ranged along the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s hopeless,&rdquo; said Peroo,
his valet, shaking his head sadly. &ldquo;Unless
I take him in hand myself.&rdquo; And
Peroo was seized with an idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>He approached Findlayson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sahib will not laugh,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He will not smile even. He has not
snickered all day. Take these, then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
They&rsquo;re straight opium, but there&rsquo;s fun
in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a small zinc bait-box from his
fishing-kit and handed it to Findlayson,
who, on opening it, found a dozen or more
brown pellets. Hastily swallowing six of
them, the sick man turned over in his
bunk and tried to go to sleep, while Peroo
went into the smoking-room for a game
of <i>Pok-Kah</i> with a party of <i>Drummerz</i>
who were crossing to America.</p>

<p>A soft yellow haze suffused the state-room,
and Findlayson, nervously starting
to his feet to see what had caused it, was
surprised to find himself confronted by a
grinning row of Technicalities ranged in
a line upon the sofa under the port, while
seated upon his steamer trunk was the
Donkey Engine 4-11-44.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; said the Deck
Beam, addressing the Donkey Engine.
&ldquo;What are we here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the Capstan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
left our places at your command. Now,
why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to meet my friend
Findlayson,&rdquo; said the Donkey Engine.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good fellow. Findlayson, let me
present you to my associates&mdash;Mr. Capstan,
Mr. Findlayson. And that gentleman
over in the corner, Mr. Findlayson,
is the Starboard Upper Deck Stringer.
Rivet, come over here and meet Mr.
Findlayson. The Davits will be here in
a minute, and the Centrifugal Bilge Pump
will drop in later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to meet you all,&rdquo; said Findlayson,
rather dazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you would be,&rdquo; returned the
Donkey Engine. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I asked
them to come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I smoke in here?&rdquo;
said the Funnel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Findlayson, solemnly.
&ldquo;Let me offer you a cigar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party roared at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t smoke cigars, Fin, old
boy,&rdquo; said the Donkey Engine. &ldquo;Offer
him a ton of coal Perfectos or a basket of
kindling Invincibles and he&rsquo;ll take you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
up. Old Funnel makes a cigarette of a
cord of pine logs, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think so much smoking
would be bad for your nerves,&rdquo; suggested
Findlayson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ain&rsquo;t got any,&rdquo; said the Funnel.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a Flue, you know. Every
once in a while I do get a sooty feeling
inside, but beyond that I don&rsquo;t suffer at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Keel?&rdquo; asked the Thrust
Block, taking off one of his six collars,
which hurt his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t come up to-night,&rdquo; said the
Donkey Engine, with a sly wink at Findlayson,
who, however, failed to respond.
&ldquo;The Hold is feeling a little rocky, and
the Keel&rsquo;s got to stay down and steady
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Findlayson looked blankly at the Donkey
Engine. As an Englishman in a nervously
disordered state, he did not seem
quite able to appreciate the Donkey Engine&rsquo;s
joke. The latter sighed, shook his
cylinder a trifle, and began again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear about the Bow Anchor&rsquo;s row
with the Captain?&rdquo; he asked the Garboard
Strake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Strake. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
he bow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d bow all right,&rdquo; said the Donkey
Engine, &ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t ank. Result
is he&rsquo;s been put in chains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serves him right,&rdquo; said the Bilge
Stringer, filling his pipe with Findlayson&rsquo;s
tooth-powder. &ldquo;Serves him right.
He ought to be chucked overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Donkey Engine. &ldquo;An
anchor can&rsquo;t be made to ank unless you
chuck him overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company roared at this, but Findlayson
never cracked a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In
fact, how could an anchor ank, as you
put it, without being lowered into the
sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad case,&rdquo; observed Bulwark
Plate, in a whisper, to the Upper Deck
Plank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It floors me,&rdquo; said the Plank. &ldquo;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d laugh if his uncle died
and left him a million.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said the Donkey Engine.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do it or bust. Let&rsquo;s try
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he added, aloud,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Technicalities, did you ever hear
that riddle of the Starboard Coal Bunker&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company properly had not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the Starboard Coal Bunker got
it off at Lady Airshaft&rsquo;s last reception at
Binks&rsquo;s Ship-yard: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the difference
between a man-o&rsquo;-war going through the
Suez Canal under tow of a tug-boat and a
boiler with a capacity of 6000 tons of
steam loaded to 7000 tons, with no safety-valve,
in charge of an engineer who has a
certificate from Bellevue Hospital showing
that he is a good ambulance-driver,
but supports a widowed mother and seven
uncles upon no income to speak of, all of
which is invested in Spanish fours, bought
on a margin of two per cent. in a Wall
Street bucket-shop conducted by two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
professional card-players from Honolulu
under indictment at San Francisco for
arson?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tutt!&rdquo; said the Rudder. &ldquo;What a
chestnut! I was brought up on riddles
of that kind. <i>They can&rsquo;t climb a tree.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; said the Donkey Engine.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know it yourself,&rdquo; suggested
the Funnel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; said the Donkey Engine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what the deuce is the answer?&rdquo;
said Findlayson, irritably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up&mdash;the rest of you?&rdquo; cried
the Donkey Engine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; they roared in chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you,&rdquo; said the Donkey
Engine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple indeed.
The man-o&rsquo;-war going through the Suez
Canal under tow of a tug-boat has a pull&mdash;and
the other hasn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Findlayson scratched his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason why you should.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
You&rsquo;re not feeling well,&rdquo; interrupted the
Donkey Engine, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a good riddle&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Findlayson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s long, anyhow,&rdquo; said the Screw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which we can&rsquo;t say for to-day&rsquo;s run&mdash;only
867 miles?&rdquo; suggested the Donkey
Engine, interrogatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s long enough,&rdquo; growled the Screw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is, if it is reckoned in
minutes,&rdquo; retorted the Donkey Engine.
&ldquo;I never knew such a long day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they continued in an honest
and technical effort to restore Findlayson.
But he wouldn&rsquo;t laugh, and finally the
Screw and the Centrifugal Bilge Pump
and the Stringers and the other well-meaning
Technicalities rose up to leave.
Day was approaching, and all were needed
at their various posts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night&mdash;or good-morning, Findlayson,&rdquo;
said the Donkey Engine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
had a very pleasant night. I am only sorry,
however, we cannot make you laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never laugh,&rdquo; said Findlayson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
&ldquo;But tell me, old chap, are you really
human? You talk as if you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the Donkey Engine,
sadly. &ldquo;I am neither fish, flesh, nor
fowl. I&rsquo;m a <i>bivalve&mdash;a cockney bivalve</i>,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Findlayson, with a gesture
of deprecation, &ldquo;you are not a clam!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Donkey Engine replied, as
with a sudden inspiration; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m a
hoister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Findlayson burst into a paroxysm
of mirth&mdash;it must be remembered that he
was English&mdash;the like of which the good
old liner never heard before.</p>

<p>And later, when Peroo returned, having
won at <i>Pok-Kah</i> with the <i>Drummerz</i>, he
found his master sleeping like the veriest
child.</p>

<p>Findlayson was saved.</p>

<h3>IN WHICH HARRY SNOBBE RECITES A TALE
OF GLOOM</h3>


<p>Monty St. Vincent had no sooner
seated himself after telling the interesting
tale of the Salvation of Findlayson, when
Billy Jones, of the <i>Oracle</i>, rose up and
stated that Mr. Harry Snobbe, as the
holder of the seventh ball, would unfold
the truly marvellous story that had come
to him after the first dinner of the
Dreamers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Snobbe requests all persons having
nerves to be unstrung to unstring
them now. His tale, he tells me, is one
of intense gloom; but how intense the
gloom may be, I know not. I will leave it
to him to show. Gentlemen, Mr. Snobbe.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Snobbe took the floor, and after a
few preliminary remarks, read as follows:</p>


<h4>THE GLOOMSTER</h4>

<p class="center">A TALE OF THE ISLE OF MAN</p>


<p>Old Gloomster Goodheart, of Ballyhack,
left the Palace of the Bishop of Man
broken-hearted. The Bishop had summoned
him a week previous to show cause
why he should not be removed from his
office of Gloomster, a position that had
been held by members of his family for
ten generations, aye, since the days of
that ancient founder of the family, Cronky
Gudehart, of whom tradition states that
his mere presence at a wedding turned
the marriage feast into a seeming funeral
ceremony, making men and women weep,
and on two occasions driving the bride to
suicide and the groom into the Church.
Indeed, Cronky Gudehart was himself the
first to occupy the office of Gloomster.
The office was created for his especial benefit,
as you will see, for it was the mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fact that the two grooms bereft at the
altar sought out the consolation of the
monastery that called the attention of the
ecclesiastical authorities to the desirability
of establishing such a functionary. The
two grooms were men of wealth, and, had
it not been for Cronky Gudehart&rsquo;s malign
influence, neither they nor their wealth
would have passed into the control of the
Church, a fact which Ramsay Ballawhaine,
then Bishop of Man, was quick to note
and act upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gloomier the world,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the more transcendently bright will
Heaven seem; and if we can make Heaven
seem bright, the Church will be able to
declare dividends. Let us spread misery
and sorrow. Let us destroy the sunshine
of life that so gilds with glory the flesh
and the devil. Let all that is worldly be
made to appear mean and vile and sordid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; Ramsay Ballawhaine was
asked. &ldquo;That is a hard thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some &rsquo;twill doubtless so appear,
but I have a plan,&rdquo; the Bishop had answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
&ldquo;We have here living, not far
from Jellimacksquizzle, the veriest spoil-sport
in the person of Cronky Gudehart.
He has a face that would change the
August beauties of a sylvan forest into a
bleak scene of wintry devastation. I am
told that when Cronky Gudehart gazes
upon a rose it withers, and children passing
him in the highways run shrieking to
their mothers, as though escaping from
the bogie man of Caine Hall&mdash;which castle,
as you know, has latterly been haunted
by horrors that surpass the imagination.
His voice is like the strident cry of doom.
Hearing his footsteps, strong men quail
and women swoon; and I am told that,
dressed as Santa Claus, on last Christmas
eve he waked up his sixteen children, and
with a hickory stick belabored one and all
until they said that mercy was all they
wanted for their Yule-tide gifts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; said the assistant vicar.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very true; and I happen to know,
through my own ministrations, that when
a beggar-woman from Sodor applied to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Cronky Gudehart for relief from the sorrows
of the world, he gave her a bottle of
carbolic acid, saying that therein lay the
cure of all her woes. But what of Cronky
and your scheme?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us establish the office of Gloomster,&rdquo;
returned the Bishop. &ldquo;Set apart
Nightmare Abbey as his official residence,
and pay him a salary to go about among
the people spreading grief and woe among
them until they fly in desperation to us
who alone can console.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of sight!&rdquo; ejaculated the assistant
vicar, &ldquo;and Cronky&rsquo;s just the man
for the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was thus that the office of Gloomster
was instituted. As will be seen, the duties
of the Gloomster were simple. He was
given liberty of entrance to all joyous
functions in the life of the Isle of Man,
social or otherwise, and his duties were to
ruin pleasure wherever he might find it.
Cronky Gudehart was installed in the office,
and Nightmare Abbey was set apart
as his official residence. He attended all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
weddings, and spoiled them in so far as he
was able. It was his custom, when the
vicar asked if there was any just reason
why these two should not be joined together
in holy wedlock, to rise up and say
that, while he had no evidence at hand,
he had no doubt there was just cause in
great plenty, and to suggest that the ceremony
should be put off a week or ten days
while he and his assistants looked into the
past records of the principals. At funerals
he took the other tack, and laughed joyously
at every manifestation of grief. At
hangings he would appear, and dilate
humorously upon the horrid features
thereof; and at afternoon teas he would
appear clad in black garments from head
to foot, and exhort all present to beware
of the future, and to give up the hollowness
and vanities of tea and macaroons.</p>

<p>Results were not long in their manifestation.
In place of open marriage the
young people of the isle, to escape the
malignant persecution of the Gloomster,
took up the habit of elopement, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
elopements always end in sorrow and
regret, the monasteries and nunneries
waxed great in the land. To avoid funerals,
at which the Gloomster&rsquo;s wit was so
fearsome a thing, the sick or the maimed
and the halt fled out into the open sea and
drowned themselves, and all sociability
save that which came from book sales and
cake auctions&mdash;in their very nature destructive
of a love of life&mdash;faded out of
the land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cronky Gudehart was an ideal Gloomster,&rdquo;
said the Bishop of Man, with a sigh,
when that worthy spoil-sport, having gone
to Africa for a vacation, was eaten by
cannibals. &ldquo;We shall not look upon his
like again.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs17.jpg" width="500" height="330" alt="THE END OF THE GLOOMSTER" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE END OF THE GLOOMSTER</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt he disagreed with the
cannibals,&rdquo; sobbed the vicar, as he thought
over the virtues of the deceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None who ate him could escape appendicitis,&rdquo;
commented the Bishop, wiping
a tear from his eye; &ldquo;and, thank
Heaven, the operation for that has yet
to be invented. Those cannibals have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
been taken by this time from their wicked
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it had gone on for ten generations.
Cronky had been succeeded by his son
and by his son&rsquo;s son, and so on. To be
Gloomster of the Isle of Man had by habit
become the prerogative of the Gudehart
family until the present, when Christian
Goodheart found himself summoned before
the Bishop to show cause why he
should not be removed. Hitherto the
Gloomster had given satisfaction. It
would be hard to point to one of them&mdash;unless
we except Eric Goodheart, the one
who changed the name from Gudehart to
Goodheart&mdash;who had not filled the island
with that kind of sorrow that makes life
seem hardly worth living. Eric Goodheart
had once caught his father, &ldquo;Bully Gudehart,&rdquo;
as he was called, in a moment of
forgetfulness, doing a kindly act to a
beggar at the door. A wanderer had appeared
at the door of Nightmare Abbey
in a starving condition, and Eric had surprised
the Gloomster in the very act of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
giving the beggar a piece of apple-pie. The
father found himself suddenly confronted
by the round, staring eyes of his son, and
he was frightened. If it were ever known
that the Gloomster had done a kindly
thing for anybody, he might be removed,
and Bully Gudehart recognized the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; he cried brutally, to
Eric, as the beggar marched away munching
hungrily on the pie. &ldquo;Come here, you
brat! Do you hear? Come <i>here</i>!&rdquo; The
boy was coming all the while. &ldquo;You saw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I saw.
The man said he was nearly dead with
hunger, and you gave him food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; roared the Gloomster, full of fear,
for he knew how small boys prattle, &ldquo;I did
not give him food! <i>I gave him pie!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, your Majesty,&rdquo; the boy answered.
&ldquo;You gave him pie. And I see
now why they call you Bully. For pie is
bully, and nothing less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; the Gloomster responded,
seizing a trunk-strap and whacking the
lad with it forcefully, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Do you know why I fed that
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he was dying of hunger,&rdquo;
replied the lad, ruefully, rubbing his back
where the trunk-strap had hit him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said the Gloomster. &ldquo;If
I hadn&rsquo;t given him that pie he&rsquo;d have
died on the premises, and I can&rsquo;t afford
the expense of having a tramp die here.
As it is, he will enjoy a lingering death.
<i>That was one of your mother&rsquo;s pies.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eric ran sobbing to his room, but in
his heart he believed that he had detected
his father in a kindly act, and conceived
that a Gloomster might occasionally relax.
Nevertheless, when he succeeded to the
office he was stern and unrelenting, in
spite of the fact that occasionally there
was to be detected in his eye a glance of
geniality. This was doubtless due to the
fact that from the time of his intrusion
upon his father&rsquo;s moment of weakness he
was soundly thrashed every morning before
breakfast, and spanked before retiring at
night, as a preliminary to his prayers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>But Christian Goodheart, the present
incumbent, had not given satisfaction,
and his Bishop had summoned him to
show cause why he should not be removed,
and, as we have seen, the Gloomster had
gone away broken-hearted. Shortly after
having arrived at Nightmare Abbey he
was greeted by his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Christian,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what did
the Bishop say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants my resignation,&rdquo; sighed
Christian. &ldquo;He says I have shown myself
unworthy, and I fear he has evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidence? Against you, my husband,
the most disagreeable man in the
isle?&rdquo; cried his wife, fondly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Christian. &ldquo;Do you remember,
you old termagant, how, forgetting
myself and my position, last Tuesday
I laughed when Peter Skelly told us what
his baby said to his nurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Christian,&rdquo; the good woman answered.
&ldquo;You laughed heartily, and I
warned you to be careful. It is not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Gloomster&rsquo;s place to laugh, and I feared
it might reach the Bishop&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has done so,&rdquo; sighed Christian,
shaking his head sadly and wringing his
hands in his agony. &ldquo;It has reached the
Bishop&rsquo;s ears. Little Glory Grouse was
passing by the door at the moment and
saw me. Astonished, the child ran home
and told her mother. &lsquo;Mommer!&rsquo; she
cried, &lsquo;I have seen the Gloomster laugh!
I have seen the Gloomster laugh!&rsquo; The
child was cross-questioned, but stuck to
her story until Mrs. Grouse was convinced,
and told her neighbors, and these
neighbors told other neighbors, until the
story came to the ears of Canon Cashman,
by whom it was conveyed to the Bishop
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a little gossip that Glory Grouse
is! She&rsquo;ll come to a bad end, mark my
words!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Goodheart, angrily.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have her honored father&rsquo;s name
on the circus posters yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not blame the child,&rdquo; said Christian,
sadly. &ldquo;She was right. Who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
ever seen a Gloomster smile before? As
well expect a ray of sunshine or a glimpse
of humor in a Manx novel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Bishop is not going to remove
you for one false step, is he, Christian?
He cannot do that, can he?&rdquo; pleaded the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I asked him,&rdquo; Christian
answered. &ldquo;And he handed me a type-written
memorandum of what he called
my record. It seems that for six months
they have been spying upon me. Read it
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodheart took the paper and read,
with trembling hands:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;January 1, 1898&mdash;wished Peggy Meguire
a happy New Year.&rsquo; Did you really,
Christian?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/gs18.jpg" width="458" height="510" alt="WISHED HER A HAPPY NEW-YEAR" title="" />
<span class="caption">WISHED HER A HAPPY NEW-YEAR</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember doing so,&rdquo; sighed the
Gloomster. &ldquo;If I did, it must have been
in sarcasm, for I hate Peggy Meguire, and
I am sure I wish her nothing of the sort.
I told the Bishop so, but all he would say
was, &lsquo;Read on.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;February 23, 1898,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mrs. Goodheart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
continued, reading from the paper&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;took
off his coat and wrapped it about
the shivering form of a freezing woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very imprudent of you, Christian!&rdquo;
said his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Bishop didn&rsquo;t know the circumstances,&rdquo;
said Christian. &ldquo;It was the
subtlest kind of deviltry, not humanity,
that prompted the act. If I hadn&rsquo;t given
her my coat, the old lady would have
frozen to death and been soon out of her
misery. As it was, my wet coat saved her
from an immediate surcease of sorrow,
and, as I had foreseen, gave her muscular
rheumatism of the most painful sort,
from which she has suffered ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have explained to the
Bishop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said my methods were too damned
artistic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Goodheart. &ldquo;The
Bishop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Christian, &ldquo;words to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that effect. He doesn&rsquo;t appreciate the
subtleties of gloom distinction. What he
looks for is sheer brutality. Might as
well employ an out-and-out desperado for
the work. I like to infuse a little art into
my work. I&rsquo;ve tried to bring Gloomsterism
up to the level of an art, a science.
Slapping a man in the face doesn&rsquo;t make
him gloomy; it makes him mad. But
subtlely infusing woe into his daily life, so
that he doesn&rsquo;t know whence all his trouble
comes&mdash;ah! that is the perfect flower
of the Gloomster&rsquo;s work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Mrs. Goodheart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
well enough, Christian. If you are rich
enough to consume your own product
with profit, it&rsquo;s all right to be artistic;
but if you are dependent on a salary, don&rsquo;t
forget your consumer. What else have
they against you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read on, woman,&rdquo; said the Gloomster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;April 1, 1898,&rsquo;&rdquo; the lady read.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Gave a half-crown to a starving beggar.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That was another highly artistic act,&rdquo;
said Christian. &ldquo;I told the Bishop that
I had given the coin to the beggar knowing
it to be counterfeit, and hoping that
he would be arrested for trying to pass it.
The Bishop cut me short by saying that
my hope had not been fulfilled. It seems
that that ass of a beggar bought some
food with the half-crown, and the grocer
who sold him the food put the counterfeit
half-crown in the contribution-box the
next Sunday, and the Church was stuck.
That&rsquo;s what I call hard luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Goodheart,
putting the paper down in despair.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to read further. That
alone is sufficient to cause your downfall.
When do you resign?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; sighed Christian. &ldquo;In fact,
the Bishop had already written my resignation&mdash;which
I signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the land is without a Gloomster
for the first time in five hundred years?&rdquo;
demanded Mrs. Goodheart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Christian, the tears coursing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
down his nose. &ldquo;The place is filled already,
and by one who knows gloom only
theoretically&mdash;a mere summer resident of
the Isle of Man. In short, a famous London
author has succeeded me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Goodheart.</p>

<hr style='width:30%' />

<p>&ldquo;Just then,&rdquo; said Snobbe, &ldquo;I awoke,
and did not catch the author&rsquo;s name. It
is a curious thing about dreams that just
when you get to the crucial point you
wake up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who the deuce the chap
could have been?&rdquo; murmured the other
diners. &ldquo;Has any London author with a
residence on the Isle of Man ever shown
any acquaintance with gloom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure,&rdquo; said Billy
Jones. &ldquo;But my impression is that it
must be the editor of <i>Punch</i>. What I am
uncertain about is his residence on the
Isle of Man. Otherwise I think he fills
the bill.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE DREAMERS DISCUSS A MAGAZINE POEM</h3>


<p>The pathetic tale of the Gloomster having
been told and discussed, it turned out
that Haarlem Bridge was the holder of the
next ball in the sequence, the eighth.
Haarley had been looking rather nervous
all the evening, and two or three times he
manifested some desire to withdraw from
the scene. By order of the chairman,
however, the precaution had been taken
to lock all the doors, so that none of the
Dreamers should escape, and, consequently,
when the evil hour arrived, Haarley
was perforce on hand.</p>

<p>He rose up reluctantly, and, taking a
single page of manuscript from his pocket,
after a few preliminary remarks that were
no more nor less coherent than the average<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
after-dinner speech, read the following
lines, which he termed a magazine
poem:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;">

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;O ARGENT-BROWED SARCOPHAGUS&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
&ldquo;O argent-browed Sarcophagus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That looms so through the ethered trees,</span><br />
Why dost thou seem to those of us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who drink the poisoned chalice on our knees</span><br />
So distant and so empyrean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So dour yet full of mystery?</span><br />
Hast thou the oracle as yet unseen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To guide thy fell misogyny?</span><br />
<br />
&ldquo;Nay, let the spirit of the age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all its mystic beauty stand</span><br />
Translucent ever, aye, in spite the rage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Cossack and of Samarcand!</span><br />
Thou art enough for any soul&rsquo;s desire!<br />
Thou hast the beauty of cerulean fire!<br />
But we who grovel on the damask earth<br />
Are we despoilt of thy exigeant mirth?<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Canst listen to a prayer, Sarcophagus?<br />
Indeed O art thou there, Sarcophagus?<br />
What time the Philistine denies,<br />
What time the raucous cynic cries,<br />
Avaunt, yet spare! Let this thy motto be,<br />
With thy thesaurian verbosity.<br />
Nor think that I, a caterpillian worm,<br />
Before thy glance should ever honk or squirm.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but the stern condition of the poor<br />
That panting brings me pottering at thy door,<br />
To breathe of love and argent charity<br />
For thee, for thee, iguanodonic thee!&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an excellent specimen of magazine
poetry,&rdquo; said Billy Jones. &ldquo;But I
observe, Haarley, that you haven&rsquo;t given it
a title. Perhaps if you gave it a title we
might get at the mystery of its meaning.
A title is a sort of Baedeker to the general
run of magazine poems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haarlem grew rather red of countenance
as he answered, &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t exactly
like to give it the title I dreamed; it
didn&rsquo;t seem to shed quite as much light
on the subject as a title should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, it may help,&rdquo; said Huddy Rivers.
&ldquo;I read a poem in a magazine the other
day on &lsquo;Mystery.&rsquo; And if it hadn&rsquo;t had a
title I&rsquo;d never have understood it. It ran
this way:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
&ldquo;Life, what art thou? Whence springest thou?<br />
The past, the future, or the now?<br />
Whence comes thy lowering lunacy?<br />
Whence comes thy mizzling mystery?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>Hast thou a form, a shape, a lineament?<br />
Hast thou a single seraph-eyed medicament<br />
To ease our sorrow and our twitching woe?<br />
Hast thou one laudable Alsatian glow<br />
To compensate, commensurate, and condign<br />
For all these dastard, sleekish qualms of mine?<br />
Hast thou indeed an abject agate plot<br />
To show that what exists is really not?<br />
Or art thou just content to sit and say<br />
Life&rsquo;s but a specious, coral roundelay?&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I committed the thing to memory because
it struck me as being a good thing
to remember&mdash;it was so full of good
phrases. &lsquo;Twitching woe,&rsquo; for instance,
and &lsquo;sleekish qualms,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quaking qualms would have been better,&rdquo;
put in Tenafly Paterson, who judged
poetry from an alliterative point of
view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I liked sleekish qualms,&rdquo;
retorted Huddy. &ldquo;Quaking qualms might
be more alliterative, but sleekish qualms
is <i>less</i> commonplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Tenafly. &ldquo;I never
had &rsquo;em myself, so I&rsquo;ll take your word for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it. But what do you make out of &lsquo;coral
roundelay&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said Huddy. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t bother my head about &lsquo;coral roundelay&rsquo;
or &lsquo;seraph-eyed medicament.&rsquo; I
haven&rsquo;t wasted an atom of my gray matter
on &lsquo;lowering lunacy&rsquo; or &lsquo;agate plot&rsquo;
or &lsquo;mizzling mystery.&rsquo; And all because
the poet gave his poem a title. He called
the thing &lsquo;Mystery,&rsquo; and when I had read
it over half a dozen times I concluded
that he was right; and if the thing remained
a mystery to the author, I don&rsquo;t
see why a reader should expect ever to be
able to understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very logical conclusion, Huddy,&rdquo; said
Billy Jones, approvingly. &ldquo;If a poet
chooses a name for his poem, you may
make up your mind that there is good
reason for it, and certainly the verses you
have recited about the &lsquo;coral roundelay&rsquo;
are properly designated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to have the title of that
yard of rhyme Haarlem Bridge just recited,&rdquo;
put in Dobbs Ferry, scratching his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
head in bewilderment. &ldquo;It strikes me as
being quite as mysterious as Huddy&rsquo;s.
What the deuce can a man mean by referring
to an &lsquo;auburn-haired Sarcophagus&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t auburn-haired,&rdquo; expostulated
Haarlem. &ldquo;It was argent-browed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Sarcophagus had nickel-plated
eyebrows, Dobby,&rdquo; cried Tom Snobbe,
forgetting himself for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who the dickens was old Sarcophagus?&rdquo;
queried Dobby, unappeased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was one of the Egyptian kings,
my dear boy,&rdquo; vouchsafed Billy Jones, exploding
internally with mirth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
heard of Augustus C&aelig;sar, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dobby.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs20.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="SARCOPHAGUSTUS" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;SARCOPHAGUSTUS&rdquo;</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; explained Billy Jones, &ldquo;Sarcophagus
occupied the same relation to
the Egyptians that Augustus did to the
Romans&mdash;in fact, the irreverent used to
call him Sarcophagustus, instead of Sarcophagus,
which was his real name. This
poem of Haarley&rsquo;s is manifestly addressed
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he have nickel-plated eyebrows?&rdquo;
asked Bedfork Parke, satirically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Billy Jones. &ldquo;As I remember
the story of Sarcophagus as I read of
him in college, he was a very pallid sort
of a potentate&mdash;his forehead was white as
marble. So they called him the Argent-browed
Sarcophagus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing for us we have Billy
Jones with us to tell us all these things,&rdquo;
whispered Tom Snobbe to his brother
Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet your life,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing, after all, like a classical education.
I wish I&rsquo;d known it while I was
getting mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s &lsquo;fell misogyny&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Tenafly
Paterson, who seemed to be somewhat
enamoured of the phrase. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t old
Sarcophagus care for chemistry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chemistry?&rdquo; demanded the chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; said Tenny.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t misogyny a chemical compound
of metal and gas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tenny had been to the School of Mines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
for two weeks, and had retired because he
didn&rsquo;t care for mathematics and the table
at the college restaurant wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy you are thinking of heterophemy,
which is an infusion of unorthodox
gases into a solution of vocabulary particles,&rdquo;
suggested Billy Jones, grasping his
sides madly to keep them from shaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Tenny, &ldquo;of course. I
remember now.&rdquo; Then he laughed somewhat,
and added, &ldquo;I always get misogyny
and heterophemy mixed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; cried Harry Snobbe.
&ldquo;I do myself! There&rsquo;s no chance to talk
about either where I live,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Half the people don&rsquo;t know what they
mean. They&rsquo;re not very anthropological
up my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Samarcand?&rdquo; asked Tenafly,
again. &ldquo;Haarley&rsquo;s poem speaks of
Cossack and of Samarcand. Of course
we all know that a Cossack is a garment
worn by the Russian peasants, but I never
heard of a Samarcand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing to put about your neck,&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
said Dick Snobbe. &ldquo;They wear &rsquo;em in
winter out in Siberia. I looked it up
some years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take up &lsquo;cerulean fire,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Bedford Parke, Tenafly appearing to be
satisfied with Snobbe&rsquo;s explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s &lsquo;cerulean fire&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue ruin,&rdquo; said Huddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;damask earth&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Bedford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; cried Huddy. &ldquo;Even I can
understand that. Did you never hear,
Beddy, of painting a town red? That&rsquo;s
damask earth in a small way. If you can
paint a town red with your limited resources,
what couldn&rsquo;t a god do with a
godlike credit? As I understand the
poem, old Sarcophagus comes down out
of the cerulean fire, and goes in for a little
damask earth. That&rsquo;s why the poet
later says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Canst listen to a prayer, Sarcophagus?<br />
Indeed O art thou there, Sarcophagus?&rsquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>He wanted to pray to him, but didn&rsquo;t know
if he&rsquo;d got back from damask earth yet.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a perfect wonder, Huddy,&rdquo; said
Billy Jones. &ldquo;As a thought-detector you
are a beauty. I believe you&rsquo;d succeed if
you opened up a literary bureau somewhere
and devoted your time to explaining
Browning and Meredith and others to
a mystified public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an excellent idea,&rdquo; said Tom
Snobbe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rejoice to see certain
modern British masterpieces translated
into English, and, with headquarters
in Boston, the institution ought to
flourish. Do worms honk?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of any doing so,&rdquo; replied
the chairman, &ldquo;but in these days it is
hardly safe to say that anything is impossible.
If you have watched the development
of the circus in the last five years&mdash;I
mean the real circus, not the literary&mdash;you
must have observed what an advance
intellectually has been made by the
various members of the animal kingdom.
Elephants have been taught to sit at table
and dine like civilized beings on things
that aren&rsquo;t good for them; pigs have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
educated so that, instead of evincing none
but the more domestic virtues and staying
contentedly at home, they now play
poker with the sangfroid of a man about
town; while the seal, a creature hitherto
considered useful only in the production
of sacques for our wives, and ear-tabs for
our children, and mittens for our hired
men, are now branching out as rivals to
the college glee clubs, singing songs, playing
banjoes, and raising thunder generally.
Therefore it need surprise no one
if a worm should learn to honk as high
as any goose that ever honked. Anyhow,
you can&rsquo;t criticise a poet for anything of
that kind. His license permits him to
take any liberties he may see fit with existing
conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of which,&rdquo; observed Dick Snobbe,
&ldquo;is wandering from the original point of
discussion. What is the meaning of Haarley&rsquo;s
poem? I can&rsquo;t see that as yet we
have reached a definite understanding on
that point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must confess,&rdquo; said Jones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
&ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t understand it myself; but I
never could understand magazine poetry,
so that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything. I&rsquo;m only
a newspaper man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the title, Haarley,&rdquo; cried
Tenafly Paterson. &ldquo;Was it called &lsquo;Life,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Nerve Cells,&rsquo; or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a second Bridge&rsquo;s cheeks grew red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you must have it,&rdquo; he said,
desperately, &ldquo;here it is. It was called,
&lsquo;A Thought on Hearing, While Visiting
Gibraltar in June, 1898, that the War Department
at Washington Had Failed to
Send Derricks to Cuba, Thereby Delaying
the Landing of General Shafter Three
Days and Giving Comfort to the Enemy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; roared Dick Snobbe.
&ldquo;What a title!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is excellent,&rdquo; said Billy Jones. &ldquo;I
now understand the intent of the poem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which was&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Rivers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To supply a real hiatus in latter-day
letters,&rdquo; Jones replied; &ldquo;to give the public
a war poem that would make them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
think, which is what a true war poem
should do. Who has the ninth ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the unfortunate holder of that,&rdquo;
said Greenwich Place. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just been
reading Anthony Hope and Mr. Dooley.
The result is a composite, which I will
read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call it, Mr. Place?&rdquo;
asked the stenographer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Greenwich.
&ldquo;I guess &lsquo;A Dooley Dialogue&rsquo;
about describes it.&rdquo;</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>DOLLY VISITS CHICAGO</h3>


<p class="center"><i>Being the substance of a Dooley dialogue dreamed
by Greenwich Place, Esq.</i></p>


<p>&ldquo;I must see him,&rdquo; said Dolly, rising
suddenly from her chair and walking to
the window. &ldquo;I really must, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I asked, rousing myself from
the lethargy into which my morning paper
had thrust me. It was not grammatical
of me&mdash;I was somewhat under the influence
of newspaper English&mdash;but Dolly
is quick to understand. &ldquo;Must see who?&rdquo;
I continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who indeed?&rdquo; cried Dolly, gazing at
me in mock surprise. &ldquo;How stupid of
you! If I went to Rome and said I must
see him, you&rsquo;d know I must mean the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Pope; if I went to Berlin and said I must
see it, you&rsquo;d know I meant the Emperor.
Therefore, when I come to Chicago and
say that I must see him, you ought to be
able to guess that I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dooley?&rdquo; I ventured, at a guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Dolly, clapping
her hands together joyously; and then
she hummed bewitchingly, &ldquo;The Boy
Guessed Right the Very First Time,&rdquo; until
I begged her to desist. When Dolly
claps her hands and hums, she becomes
a vision of loveliness that would give
the most confirmed misogynist palpitation
of the heart, and I had no wish to
die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I could call upon
him without being thought too unconventional?&rdquo;
she blurted out in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do anything,&rdquo; said I, admiringly.
&ldquo;That is, with me to help,&rdquo; I added,
for I should be sorry if Dolly were to
grow conceited. &ldquo;Perhaps it would be
better to have Mr. Dooley call upon you.
Suppose you send him your card, and put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
&lsquo;at home&rsquo; on it? I fancy that would
fetch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy thought!&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;Only
I haven&rsquo;t one. In the excitement of our
elopement I forgot to get any. Suppose I
write my name on a blank card and send
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>And so it happened; the morning&rsquo;s
mail took out an envelope addressed to
Mr. Dooley, and containing a bit of pasteboard
upon which was written, in the
charming hand of Dolly:</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">Mrs. R. Dolly-Rassendyll.<br />
At Home.<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hippodorium.<br />
Tuesday Afternoon.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs22.jpg" width="500" height="340" alt="I MUST SEE HIM" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;I MUST SEE HIM,&rsquo; SAID DOLLY&rdquo;</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The response was gratifyingly immediate.</p>

<p>The next morning Dolly&rsquo;s mail contained
Mr. Dooley&rsquo;s card, which read as
follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">
Mr. Dooley.<br />
At Work.<br />
Every Day. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Archie Road.<br />
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo; said Dolly, tossing
the card across the table to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That if you want to see Dooley you&rsquo;ll
have to call upon him at his place of business.
It&rsquo;s a saloon, I believe,&rdquo; I observed.
&ldquo;Or a club&mdash;most American saloons are
clubs, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s a ladies&rsquo; day
there?&rdquo; laughed Dolly. &ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t,
perhaps I&rsquo;d better not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I of course agreed, for when Dolly
thinks perhaps she&rsquo;d better not, I always
agree with her, particularly when the
thing is a trifle unconventional.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said, as we reached
the conclusion. &ldquo;To visit Chicago without
meeting Mr. Dooley strikes me as like
making the Mediterranean trip without
seeing Gibraltar.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>But we were not to be disappointed,
after all, for that afternoon who should
call but the famous philosopher himself,
accompanied by his friend Mr. Hennessey.
They were ushered into our little parlor,
and Dolly received them radiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iv coorse,&rdquo; said Dooley, &ldquo;I hatter
come t&rsquo; see me new-found cousin. Hennessey
here says, he says, &lsquo;She ain&rsquo;t yer
cousin,&rsquo; he says; but whin I read yer
car-r-rd over th&rsquo; second time, an&rsquo; see yer
na-a-ame was R. Dooley-Rassendyll, wid th&rsquo;
hifalution betwixt th&rsquo; Dooley an&rsquo; th&rsquo; Rassendyll,
I says, &lsquo;Hennessey,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;that
shmall bit iv a coupler in that na-a-ame
means only wan thing,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Th&rsquo; la-ady,&rsquo;
I says, &lsquo;was born a Dooley, an&rsquo; &rsquo;s
prood iv it,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;as she&rsquo;d ought to be,&rsquo;
I says. &lsquo;Shure enough,&rsquo; says Hennessey;
&lsquo;but they&rsquo;s Dooleys an&rsquo; Dooleys,&rsquo; he says.
&lsquo;Is she Roscommon or Idunnaw?&rsquo; he says.
&lsquo;I dinnaw meself,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;but whichiver
she is,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to see her,&rsquo; I
says. &lsquo;Anny wan that can feel at home
in a big hotel like the Hippojorium,&rsquo; I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
says, &lsquo;is wort&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at, if only for the
curawsity of it,&rsquo; I says. Are ye here for
long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are just passing through,&rdquo; said
Dolly, with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gud pla-ace for that,&rdquo; said Dooley.
&ldquo;Thim as pass troo Chicago ginerally
go awaa pleased, an&rsquo; thim as stays t&rsquo;ink
it&rsquo;s th&rsquo; only pla-ace in th&rsquo; worruld, gud
luk to &rsquo;em! for, barrin&rsquo; Roscommon an&rsquo;
New York, it&rsquo;s th&rsquo; only pla-ace I have
anny use for. Is yer hoosband anny relation
t&rsquo; th&rsquo; dood in the <i>Prizner iv Cinders</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed quietly, but did not resent
the implication. I left Dolly to her fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the very same person,&rdquo; said
Dolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I t&rsquo;ought as much,&rdquo; said Dooley, eying
me closely. &ldquo;Th&rsquo; strorberry mark on his
hair sort of identified him,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Cousin Roopert, I ta-ak ye by the hand.
Ye was a bra-ave lad in th&rsquo; first book, an&rsquo;
a dom&rsquo;d fool in th&rsquo; second; but I read th&rsquo;
second first, and th&rsquo; first lasht, so whin I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
left ye ye was all right. I t&rsquo;ought ye was
dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am only dead in the
sense that Mr. Hope has no further use
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise mon, that Mr. Ant&rsquo;ny Hawp,&rdquo;
said Dooley. &ldquo;Whin I write me book,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; shtop short whin
folks have had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; cried Dolly, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Are you writing a book, Mr.
Dooley? I am so glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Dooley, deprecatingly, yet
pleased by Dolly&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half
finished already. That is to say, I&rsquo;ve made
th&rsquo; illusthrations. An&rsquo; the publishers have
accepted the book on th&rsquo; stringth iv them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;Do you really
draw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nawm,&rdquo; said Dooley. &ldquo;I niver drew
a picture in me life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He draws corks,&rdquo; put in Hennessey.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a pull that bates&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hennessey,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Dooley,
&ldquo;since whin have ye been me funnygraph?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Whin me cousin ashks me riddles, I&rsquo;ll tell
her th&rsquo; answers. G&rsquo; down-shtairs an&rsquo; get
a cloob san&rsquo;wich an&rsquo; ate yourself to death.
Char-rge it to&mdash;er&mdash;char-rge it to Misther
Rassendyll here&mdash;me cousin Roop, be
marritch. He looks liks a soft t&rsquo;ing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hennessey subsided and showed an inclination
to depart, and I, not liking to
see a well-meaning person thus sat upon,
tried to be pleasant to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go just yet, Mr. Hennessey,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I should like to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rassendyll,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
goin&rsquo; just yet, but an invitation to join
farces with one iv the Hippojorium&rsquo;s cloob
sandwhiches is too much for me. I must
accept. Phwat is the noomber iv your
shweet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave him the number, and Hennessey
departed. Before he went, however, he
comforted me somewhat by saying that
he too was &ldquo;a puppit in th&rsquo; han&rsquo;s iv an
auter. Ye&rsquo;ve got to do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whativer
ye&rsquo;re sint t&rsquo; do. I&rsquo;m told ye&rsquo;ve killed
a million Germans&mdash;bless ye!&mdash;but ye&rsquo;re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
nawthin&rsquo; but a facthory hand afther all.
I&rsquo;m th&rsquo; background iv Dooley. If Dooley
wants to be smar-rt, I&rsquo;ve got t&rsquo; play th&rsquo;
fool. It&rsquo;s the same with you; only you&rsquo;ve
had yer chance at a printcess, later on
pla-acin&rsquo; the la-ady in a &rsquo;nonymous p&rsquo;sition&mdash;which
is enough for anny man, Dooley
or no Dooley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hennessey departed in search of his
club sandwich, which was subsequently
alluded to in my bill, and for which I paid
with pleasure, for Hennessey is a good fellow.
I then found myself listening to the
conversation between Dolly and Dooley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roscommon, of course,&rdquo; Dolly was saying.
What marvellous adaptability that
woman has! &ldquo;How could you think, my
dear cousin, that I belonged to the farmer
Dooleys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I t&rsquo;ought as much,&rdquo; said Mr. Dooley,
genially, &ldquo;now that I&rsquo;ve seen ye. Whin
you put th&rsquo; wor-rds &lsquo;at home&rsquo; on yer
car-rd, I had me doots. No Dooley iv th&rsquo;
right sor-rt iver liked annyt&rsquo;ing a landlord
gave him; an&rsquo; whin y&rsquo; expreshed satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
wid th&rsquo; Hippojorium, I didn&rsquo;t at
first t&rsquo;ink ye was a true Dooley. Since I&rsquo;ve
seen ye, I love ye properly, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;like
th&rsquo; cousin I am. I&rsquo;ve read iv ye, just as
I&rsquo;ve read iv yer hoosband, Cousin Roopert
here be marritch, in th&rsquo; biojographies of
Mr. Ant&rsquo;ny Hawp, an&rsquo; while I cudn&rsquo;t help
likin&rsquo; ye, I must say I didn&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink ye was
very deep on th&rsquo; surface, an&rsquo; when I read
iv your elopin&rsquo; with Cousin Roop, I says
to Hennessey, I says, &lsquo;Hennessey,&rsquo; I says,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s all right, they&rsquo;d bote iv &rsquo;em better
die, but let us not be asashinators,&rsquo; I says;
&lsquo;let &rsquo;em be joined in marritch. That&rsquo;s
punishment enough,&rsquo; I says to Hennessey.
Ye see, Miss Dooley, I have been marrit
meself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have found married life far from
punishment,&rdquo; I heard Dolly say. &ldquo;I fear
you&rsquo;re a sad pessimist, Mr. Dooley,&rdquo; she
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Mr. Dooley replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a Jimmycrat out an&rsquo; out, if ye refer to me
politics; but if your remark is a reflection
on me religion, let me tell ye, ma&rsquo;am,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that, like all me countrymen in this beautiful
land, I&rsquo;m a Uni-tarrian, an&rsquo; prood iv it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ventured to interpose at this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dooley,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your cousin Roop,
as you call him, is very glad to meet you,
whatever your politics or your religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mosht people are,&rdquo; said he, dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shows good taste,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But
how about your book? It has been accepted
on the strength of its illustrations,
you say. How about them? Can we see
them anywhere? Are they on exhibition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can not only see thim, but you
can drink &rsquo;em free anny time you come
out to Archie Road,&rdquo; Dooley replied, cordially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink&mdash;a picture?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Dooley. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye iver
hear iv dhrinkin&rsquo; in a picture, Cousin Roopert?
Didn&rsquo;t ye hear th&rsquo; tark about th&rsquo;
&lsquo;Angelus&rsquo; whin &rsquo;twas here? Ye cud hear
th&rsquo; bells ringin&rsquo; troo th&rsquo; paint iv it. Ye
cud almost hear th&rsquo; couple in front just

&rsquo;twas th&rsquo; Angelus er the facthery bell that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was goin&rsquo; off. &rsquo;Twas big an&rsquo; little felt
th&rsquo; inflooance iv Misther Miller&rsquo;s jaynius,
just be lukin&rsquo; at ut&mdash;though as fer me, th&rsquo;
fir-rst time I see the t&rsquo;ing I says, says I,
&lsquo;Is ut lukin&rsquo; for bait to go fishin&rsquo; with
they are?&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t ye hear the
pealin&rsquo; iv the bells?&rsquo; says Hennessey, who
was with me. &lsquo;That an&rsquo; more,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;I
can hear the pealin&rsquo; o&rsquo; th&rsquo; petayties,&rsquo; I says.
&lsquo;Do ye dhrink in th&rsquo; feelin&rsquo; iv it?&rsquo; says
Hennessey. &lsquo;Naw, t&rsquo;ank ye,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
not thirsty,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Besides, I&rsquo;ve swore off
dhrinkin&rsquo; ile-paintin&rsquo;s,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Wathercoolers
is gud enough fer me,&rsquo; I says. An&rsquo;
wid that we wint back to the Road. But
that was th&rsquo; fir-rst time I iver heard iv
dhrinkin&rsquo; a work iv ar-rt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But some of the things you&mdash;ah&mdash;you
Americans drink,&rdquo; put in Dolly, &ldquo;are
works of art, my dear Mr. Dooley. Your
cousin Rupert gave me a cocktail at dinner
last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve hit ut, Miss Dooley,&rdquo; returned
the philosopher, with a beautiful enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve hit ut square. I see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
now y&rsquo;re a thrue Dooley. An&rsquo; wid yer
kind permission I&rsquo;ll dedicate me book to
ye. Ut&rsquo;s cocktails that book&rsquo;s about,
ma&rsquo;am. <i>Fifty Cocktails I Have Met</i> is th&rsquo;
na-ame iv ut. An&rsquo; whin I submitted th&rsquo;
mannyscrip&rsquo; wid th&rsquo; illusthrations to the
publisher, he dhrank &rsquo;em all, an&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;Dooley,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;ut&rsquo;s a go. I&rsquo;ll do yer
book,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pay ye wan hoondred
an&rsquo; siventy-five per cent.,&rsquo; he says.
&lsquo;Set &rsquo;em up again, Dooley,&rsquo; he says; an&rsquo;
I mixed &rsquo;em. &lsquo;I t&rsquo;ink, Dooley,&rsquo; he says,
afther goin&rsquo; troo th&rsquo; illusthrations th&rsquo; second

to get two hoondred an&rsquo; wan per cent. on
th&rsquo; retail price iv th&rsquo; book,&rsquo; he says.
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I take a bottle iv these illusthrations
to me office?&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to
look &rsquo;em over,&rsquo; he says; an&rsquo; I mixed &rsquo;im
up a quar-rt iv th&rsquo; illusthrations to th&rsquo;
chapther on th&rsquo; Mar-rtinney, an&rsquo; sent him
back to his partner in th&rsquo; ambylanch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall look forward to the publication
of your book with much interest, Mr.
Dooley,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;Now that I have
discovered our cousinship, I am even more
interested in you than I was before; and
let me tell you that, before I met you,
I thought of you as the most vital figure
in American humor that has been produced
in many years.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&ldquo;I know nothin&rsquo; iv American humor,&rdquo;
said Dooley, &ldquo;for I haven&rsquo;t met anny lately,
an&rsquo; I know nothin&rsquo; iv victuals save
what I ate, an&rsquo; me appytite is as satisfoid
wid itself as Hobson is wid th&rsquo; kisses
brawt onto him by th&rsquo; sinkin&rsquo; iv th&rsquo;
Merrimickinley. But for you an&rsquo; Misther
Rassendyll, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; but good
wishes an&rsquo; ah&mdash;illusthrations to me book
whenever ye give yer orders. Kape your
hoosband home, Miss Dooley,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s scrapped wanst too often already
wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; Ruraltarriers, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been killed
off wanst by Mr. Ant&rsquo;ny Hawp; but he&rsquo;ll
niver die if ye only kape him home. If
he goes out he&rsquo;ll git fightin&rsquo; agin. If he
attimpts a sayquil to the sayquil, he&rsquo;s dead
sure enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with this Dolly and Dooley parted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>For myself, Rupert Rassendyll, I think
Dooley&rsquo;s advice was good, and as long as
Dolly will keep me home, I&rsquo;ll stay. For
is it not better to be the happy husband
of Dolly of the Dialogues, than to be going
about like a knight of the Middle
Ages clad in the evening dress of the nineteenth
century, doing impossible things?</p>

<p>As for Dooley&rsquo;s impression of Dolly, I
can only quote what I heard he had said
after meeting her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Dooley sure,&rdquo; said he, being
novel to compliment. And I am glad she
is, for despite the charms of Flavia of
pleasant memory, there&rsquo;s nobody like Dolly
for me, and if Dolly can only be acknowledged
by the Dooleys, her fame, I
am absolutely confident, is assured.</p>

<h3>IN WHICH YELLOW JOURNALISM CREEPS
IN</h3>


<p>The applause which followed the reading
of the Dooley Dialogue showed very
clearly that, among the diners at least,
neither Dooley nor Dolly had waned in
popularity. If the dilution, the faint echo
of the originals, evoked such applause, how
potent must have been the genius of the
men who first gave life to Dooley and the
fair Dolly!</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good stuff, Greenwich,&rdquo; said
Billie Jones. &ldquo;You must have eaten a
particularly digestible meal. Now for the
tenth ball. Who has it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Dick Snobbe, rising majestically
from his chair. &ldquo;And I can tell you
what it is; I had a tough time of it in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dream, as you will perceive when I recite
to you the story of my experiences at the
battle of Manila.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott, Dick!&rdquo; cried Bedford
Parke. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t in that, were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;I was not only
<i>in</i> it, I was the thing itself. I was the
war correspondent of the Sunday <i>Whirnal</i>,
attached to Dewey&rsquo;s fleet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the talented Mr. Snobbe
proceeded to read the following cable despatch
from the special correspondent of
the <i>Whirnal</i>:</p>


<p class="center">MANILA FALLS<br />
<small>THE SPANISH FLEET DESTROYED</small><br />
THE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE <i>WHIRNAL</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Aided by Commodore Dewey and his Fleet</span><br />
CAPTURES THE PHILIPPINES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, <i>May 1, 1898</i>.&mdash;I have glorious
news. I have this day destroyed the
Spanish fleet and captured the Philippine
Islands. According to my instructions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
from the City Editor of the <i>Whirnal</i>, I
boarded the <i>Olympia</i>, the flag-ship of the
fleet under Commodore Dewey at Hong-kong,
on Wednesday last. Upon reading
my credentials the Commodore immediately
surrendered the command of the
fleet to me, and retired to his state-room,
where he has since remained. I deemed
it well to keep him there until after the
battle was over, fearing lest he should annoy
me with suggestions, and not knowing
but that he might at any time spread
dissension among the officers and men,
who, after the habit of seamen, frequently
manifest undue affection and sympathy
for a deposed commander. I likewise,
according to your wishes, concealed from
the officers and crew the fact that the
Commodore had been deposed, furthering
the concealment by myself making up as
Dewey. Indeed, it was not until after
the battle this morning that any but
Dewey and the ship&rsquo;s barber were aware
of the substitution, since my disguise was
perfect. The ship&rsquo;s barber I had to take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>into my confidence, for unfortunately on
leaving Hong-kong I had forgotten to
provide myself with a false mustache, so
that in concealing the deposition of the
Commodore by myself assuming his personality
I was compelled to have the gentleman&rsquo;s
mustache removed from his upper
lip and transferred to my own. This
the barber did with neatness and despatch,
I having first chloroformed the Commodore,
from whom some resistance might
have been expected, owing to his peculiar
temperament. Fortunately the fellow was
an expert wig-maker, and within an hour
of the shaving of Dewey I was provided
with a mustache which could not fail to
be recognized as the Commodore&rsquo;s, since it
was indeed that very same object. When
five hundred miles at sea I dropped the
barber overboard, fearing lest he should
disturb my plans by talking too much. I
hated to do it, but in the interest of the
<i>Whirnal</i> I hold life itself as of little consequence,
particularly if it is the life of
some one else&mdash;and who knows but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
poor fellow was an expert swimmer, and
has by this time reached Borneo or some
other bit of dry land? He was alive when
I last saw him, and yelling right lustily. If
it so happen that he has swum ashore somewhere,
kindly let me know at your convenience;
for beneath a correspondent&rsquo;s
exterior I have a warm heart, and it sometimes
troubles me to think that the poor
fellow may have foundered, since the sea
was stressful and the nearest dry point
was four hundred and sixty knots away
to S.E. by N.G., while the wind was blowing
N.W. by N.Y.C. &amp; H.R.R. But to
my despatch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>Dewey done for, despoiled of his mustache
and rifled of his place, with a heavy
sea running and a dense fog listing to
starboard, I summoned my officers to the
flag-ship, and, on the evening of April 30th,
the fog-horns of Cavit&eacute; having indicated
the approach of the Philippine coast, gave
them, one and all, their final instructions.
These were, in brief, never to do anything
without consulting with me.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To facilitate matters, gentlemen,&rdquo; said
I, ordering an extra supply of grog for the
captains, and milk punches for the lieutenants,
&ldquo;we must connect the various
vessels of the fleet with telephone wires.
Who will undertake this perilous duty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rose up as one man, and, with the
precision of a grand-opera chorus, replied:
&ldquo;Commodore&rdquo;&mdash;for they had not penetrated
my disguise&mdash;&ldquo;call upon us. If
you will provide the wires and the &rsquo;phones,
we will do the rest.&rdquo; And they followed
these patriotic words with cheers for me.</p>

<p>Their heroism so affected me that I had
difficulty in frowning upon the head-butler&rsquo;s
suggestion that my glass should be
filled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, huskily&mdash;for I was
visibly affected&mdash;&ldquo;I have provided for
all. I could not do otherwise and remain
myself. You will find ten thousand
miles of wire and sixty-six telephones in
the larder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night every ship in the fleet was
provided with telephone service. I appointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the <i>Olympia</i> to be the central
office, so that I might myself control all
the messages, or at least hear them as they
passed to and fro. In the absence of ladies
from the fleet, I appointed a somewhat
effeminate subaltern to the post of &ldquo;Hello
Officer,&rdquo; with complete control over the
switch-board. And, as it transpired, this
was a very wise precaution, because the
central office was placed in the hold, and
the poor little chap&rsquo;s courage was so inclined
to ooze that in the midst of the
fight he was content to sit below the water-line
at his post, and not run about
the promenade-deck giving orders while
under fire. I have cabled the President
about him, and have advised his promotion.
His heroic devotion to the switch-board
ought to make him a naval attach&eacute;
to some foreign court, at least. I trust
his bravery will ultimately result in his
being sent to the Paris Exposition as
charge d&rsquo;affaires in the Erie Canal department
of the New York State exhibit.</p>

<p>But to return to my despatch&mdash;which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>from this point must disregard space and
move quickly. Passing Cape Bolinao, we
soon reached Subig Bay, fifty miles from
Manila. Recognizing the cape by the
crop of hemp on its brow, I rang up the
<i>Boston</i> and the <i>Concord</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search Subig Bay,&rdquo; I ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; came the answer from
the other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind who I am,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Search
Subig Bay for Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said the <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the deuce are you?&rdquo; cried the
<i>Concord</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seventeen-five-six,&rdquo; I replied, with
some sarcasm, for that was not my number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want sixteen-two-one,&rdquo; retorted the
<i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring off,&rdquo; said the <i>Concord</i>. &ldquo;What
do you mean by giving me seventeen-five-six?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, <i>Boston</i> and <i>Concord</i>,&rdquo; I put in
in commanding tones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dewey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the only false statement I ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
made, but it was in the interests of my
country, and my reply was electrical in
its effect. The <i>Boston</i> immediately blew
off steam, and the <i>Concord</i> sounded all
hands to quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Commodore?&rdquo;
they asked simultaneously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search Subig Bay for Spaniards, as I
have already ordered you,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and
woe be unto you if you don&rsquo;t find any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want &rsquo;em for, Commodore?&rdquo;
asked the <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To engage, you idiot,&rdquo; I replied,
scornfully. &ldquo;What did you suppose&mdash;to
teach me Spanish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both vessels immediately piped all hands
on deck and set off. Two hours later they
returned, and the telephone subaltern reported,
&ldquo;No Spaniards found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All gone to Cuba,&rdquo; replied the <i>Boston</i>.
&ldquo;Shall we pipe all hands to Cuba?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wires too short to penetrate without
a bust,&rdquo; replied the <i>Concord</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On to Manila!&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;Ding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>the torpedoes&mdash;go ahead! Give us Spaniards
or give us death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words inspired every ship in the
line, and we immediately strained forward,
except the <i>McCulloch</i>, which I despatched
at once to Hong-kong to cable
my last words to you in time for the Adirondack
edition of your Sunday issue
leaving New York Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The rest of us immediately proceeded.
In a short while, taking advantage of the
darkness for which I had provided by
turning the clock back so that the sun by
rising at the usual hour should not disclose
our presence, we turned Corregidor
and headed up the Boca Grande towards
Manila. As we were turning Corregidor
the telephone-bell rang, and somebody
who refused to give his name, but stating
that he was aboard the <i>Petrel</i>, called me up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dewey?&rdquo; said the <i>Petrel</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are torpedoes ahead,&rdquo; said the
<i>Petrel</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall we treat &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blow &rsquo;em off&mdash;to soda water,&rdquo; I answered,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; the <i>Petrel</i> replied,
as she rang off.</p>

<p>Then somebody from the <i>Baltimore</i>
rang me up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Commodore Dewey,&rdquo; said the <i>Baltimore</i>,
&ldquo;there are mines in the harbor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked the <i>Baltimore</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treat them coldly, as they do in the
Klondike,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they aren&rsquo;t gold-mines,&rdquo; replied
the <i>Baltimore</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then salt &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said I, dryly. &ldquo;Apply
for a certificate of incorporation, water
your stock, sell out, and retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Commodore,&rdquo; the <i>Baltimore</i>
answered. &ldquo;How many shares shall
we put you down for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ll use
your surplus to start a life-insurance company,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll take out a policy for forty-eight
hours, and send you my demand note to
pay for the first premium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mention this merely to indicate to
your readers that I felt myself in a position
of extreme peril, and did not forget
my obligations to my family. It is a small
matter, but if you will search the pages of
history you will see that in the midst of
the greatest dangers the greatest heroes
have thought of apparently insignificant
details.</p>

<p>At this precise moment we came in
sight of the fortresses of Manila. Signalling
the <i>Raleigh</i> to heave to, I left the
flag-ship and jumped aboard the cruiser,
where I discharged with my own hand the
after-forecastle four-inch gun. The shot
struck Corregidor, and, glancing off, as
I had designed, caromed on the smoke-stack
of the <i>Reina Cristina</i>, the flag-ship
of Admiral Montojo. The Admiral, unaccustomed
to such treatment, immediately
got out of bed, and, putting on his
pajamas, appeared on the bridge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">A CLEVER CAROM</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who smoked our struck-stack?&rdquo; he
demanded, in broken English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemy,&rdquo; cried his crew, with some
nervousness. I was listening to their
words through the megaphone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let her sink,&rdquo; said he, clutching
his brow sadly with his clinched fist.
&ldquo;Far be it from me to stay afloat in
Manila Bay on the 1st of May, and so
cast discredit on history!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Reina Cristina</i> immediately sank,
according to the orders of the Admiral,
and I turned my attention to the <i>Don
Juan de Austria</i>. Rowing across the
raging channel to the <i>Baltimore</i>, I boarded
her and pulled the lanyard of the port
boom forty-two. The discharge was terrific.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; I asked, coolly,
as the explosion exploded. &ldquo;Did we hit
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did, your honor,&rdquo; said the Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n&rsquo;s
mate, &ldquo;square in the eye; only, Commodore,
it ain&rsquo;t a her this time&mdash;it&rsquo;s a him.
It&rsquo;s the <i>Don Juan de</i>&mdash;&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the sex,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Has
she sank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n&rsquo;s mate,
&ldquo;she &rsquo;ain&rsquo;t sank yet. She&rsquo;s a-waiting
orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly signals to sink,&rdquo; said I, sternly,
for I had resolved that she should go
down.</p>

<p>They did so, and the <i>Don Juan de
Austria</i> immediately disappeared beneath
the waves. Her commander evidently
realized that I meant what I signalled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any more of the enemy
afloat?&rdquo; I demanded, jumping from the
deck of the <i>Baltimore</i> to that of the <i>Concord</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Commodore,&rdquo; replied the captain
of the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then signal the enemy to charter two
more gunboats and have &rsquo;em sent out. I
can&rsquo;t be put off with two boats when I&rsquo;m
ready to sink four,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<span class="caption">SINKING THE CASTILLA</span>

<p>The <i>Concord</i> immediately telephoned to
the Spanish commandant at the Manila
Caf&eacute; de la Paix, who as quickly chartered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the <i>Castilla</i> and the <i>Velasco</i>&mdash;two very
good boats that had recently come in in
ballast with the idea of loading up with
bananas and tobacco.</p>

<p>While waiting for these vessels to come
out and be sunk, I ordered all hands to
breakfast, thus reviving their falling courage.
It was a very good breakfast, too.
We had mush and hominy and potatoes
in every style, beefsteak, chops, liver and
bacon, chicken hash, buckwheat cakes
and fish-balls, coffee, tea, rolls, toast,
and brown bread.</p>

<p>Just as we were eating the latter the
<i>Castilla</i> and <i>Velasco</i> came out. I fired my
revolver at the <i>Castilla</i> and threw a fish-ball
at the <i>Velasco</i>. Both immediately
burst into flames.</p>

<p>Manila was conquered.</p>

<p>The fleet gone, the city fell. It not
only fell, but slid, and by nightfall Old
Glory waved over the citadel.</p>

<p>The foe was licked.</p>

<p>To-morrow I am to see Dewey again.</p>

<p>I think I shall resign to-night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MYSTERY OF PINKHAM&rsquo;S DIAMOND
STUD</h3>


<p class="center"><i>Being the tale told by the holder of the eleventh ball,
Mr. Fulton Streete</i></p>


<p>&ldquo;It is the little things that tell in detective
work, my dear Watson,&rdquo; said Sherlock
Holmes as we sat over our walnuts
and coffee one bitter winter night shortly
before his unfortunate departure to Switzerland,
whence he never returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is so,&rdquo; said I, pulling
away upon the very excellent stogie which
mine host had provided&mdash;one made in
Pittsburg in 1885, and purchased by
Holmes, whose fine taste in tobacco had
induced him to lay a thousand of these
down in his cigar-cellar for three years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and then keep them in a refrigerator,
overlaid with a cloth soaked in Ch&acirc;teau
Yquem wine for ten. The result may be
better imagined than described. Suffice
it to say that my head did not recover for
three days, and the ash had to be cut off
the stogie with a knife. &ldquo;I suppose so,
my dear Holmes,&rdquo; I repeated, taking my
knife and cutting three inches of the
stogie off and casting it aside, furtively,
lest he should think I did not appreciate
the excellence of the tobacco, &ldquo;but it is
not given to all of us to see the little
things. Is it, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, rising and picking up
the rejected portion of the stogie. &ldquo;We
all see everything that goes on, but we
don&rsquo;t all know it. We all hear everything
that goes on, but we are not conscious of
the fact. For instance, at this present
moment there is somewhere in this world
a man being set upon by assassins and
yelling lustily for help. Now his yells
create a certain atmospheric disturbance.
Sound is merely vibration, and, once set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
going, these vibrations will run on and on
and on in ripples into the infinite&mdash;that
is, they will never stop, and sooner or later
these vibrations must reach our ears. We
may not know it when they do, but they
will do so none the less. If the man is in
the next room, we will hear the yells almost
simultaneously&mdash;not quite, but almost&mdash;with
their utterance. If the man
is in Timbuctoo, the vibrations may not
reach us for a little time, according to the
speed with which they travel. So with
sight. Sight seems limited, but in reality
it is not. <i>Vox populi, vox Dei</i>. If
<i>vox</i>, why not <i>oculus</i>? It is a simple proposition,
then, that the eye of the people
being the eye of God, the eye of God being
all-seeing, therefore the eye of the
people is all-seeing&mdash;Q. E. D.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gasped, and Holmes, cracking a walnut,
gazed into the fire for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all comes down, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to
the question, who are the people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holmes smiled grimly. &ldquo;All men,&rdquo; he
replied, shortly; &ldquo;and when I say all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
men, I mean all creatures who can reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that include women?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Indubitably.
The fact that women <i>don&rsquo;t</i> reason does
not prove that they can&rsquo;t. I <i>can</i> go up in
a balloon if I wish to, but I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>. I <i>can</i>
read an American newspaper comic supplement,
but I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>. So it is with women.
Women can reason, and therefore
they have a right to be included in the
classification whether they do or don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; was all I could think of to
say at the moment. The extraordinary
logic of the man staggered me, and I again
began to believe that the famous mathematician
who said that if Sherlock
Holmes attempted to prove that five apples
plus three peaches made four pears,
he would not venture to dispute his conclusions,
was wise. (This was the famous
Professor Zoggenhoffer, of the Leipsic
School of Moral Philosophy and Stenography.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you agree, my dear Watson,&rdquo; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;that I have proved that we see
everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether we are conscious of it or
not?&rdquo; he added, lighting the gas-log, for
the cold was becoming intense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that point of view, I suppose so&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
I replied, desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, this being granted, consciousness
is all that is needed to make
us fully informed on any point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, with some positiveness.
&ldquo;The American people are very conscious,
but I can&rsquo;t say that generally they are
well-informed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had an idea this would knock him out,
as the Bostonians say, but counted without
my host. He merely laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The American is only self-conscious.
Therefore he is well-informed only as to
self,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve proved your point, Sherlock,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Go on. What else have you
proved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it is the little things that tell,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he replied. &ldquo;Which all men would realize
in a moment if they could see the little
things&mdash;and when I say &lsquo;if they could
see,&rsquo; I of course mean if they could be
conscious of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have the gift of consciousness,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>I thought he had, and I said so. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
I added, &ldquo;give me a concrete example.&rdquo;
It had been some weeks since I had listened
to any of his detective stories, and I was
athirst for another.</p>

<p>He rose up and walked over to his
pigeon-holes, each labelled with a letter,
in alphabetical sequence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only to refer to any of these
to do so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Choose your letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Holmes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
need to do that. I&rsquo;ll believe all you say.
In fact, I&rsquo;ll write it up and <i>sign my
name</i> to any statement you choose to
make.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<span class="caption">THE LAMP-POSTS WERE TWISTED</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Choose your letter, Watson,&rdquo; he retorted.
&ldquo;You and I are on terms that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
make flattery impossible. Is it F, J, P,
Q, or Z?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fixed his eye penetratingly upon me.
It seemed for the moment as if I were hypnotized,
and as his gaze fairly stabbed me
with its intensity, through my mind there
ran the suggestion &ldquo;Choose J, choose J,
choose J.&rdquo; To choose J became an obsession.
To relieve my mind, I turned my
eye from his and looked at the fire. Each
flame took on the form of the letter J. I
left my chair and walked to the window
and looked out. The lamp-posts were
twisted into the shape of the letter J. I
returned, sat down, gulped down my
brandy-and-soda, and looked up at the
portraits of Holmes&rsquo;s ancestors on the
wall. They were all J&rsquo;s. But I was resolved
never to yield, and I gasped out,
desperately,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Z!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, calmly. &ldquo;Z be it.
I thought you would. Reflex hypnotism,
my dear Watson, is my forte. If I wish a
man to choose Q, B takes hold upon him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
If I wish him to choose K, A fills his
mind. Have you ever observed how the
mind of man repels a suggestion and flees
to something else, merely that it may
demonstrate its independence of another
mind? Now I have been suggesting J to
you, and you have chosen Z&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You misunderstood me,&rdquo; I cried,
desperately. &ldquo;I did not say Z; I said
P.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said he, with an inward
chuckle. &ldquo;P was the letter I wished you
to choose. If you had insisted upon Z,
I should really have been embarrassed.
See!&rdquo; he added. He removed the green-ended
box that rested in the pigeon-hole
marked Z, and, opening it, disclosed an
emptiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a Z case. But P,&rdquo; he
observed, quietly, &ldquo;is another thing altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he took out the box marked P
from the pigeon-hole, and, opening it, removed
the contents&mdash;a single paper which
was carefully endorsed, in his own handwriting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Mystery of Pinkham&rsquo;s Diamond
Stud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could not have selected a better
case, Watson,&rdquo; he said, as he unfolded
the paper and scanned it closely. &ldquo;One
would almost think you had some prevision
of the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not aware,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you
ever told the story of Pinkham&rsquo;s diamond
stud. Who was Pinkham, and what kind
of a diamond stud was it&mdash;first-water or
Rhine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pinkham,&rdquo; Holmes rejoined, &ldquo;was an
American millionaire, living during business
hours at Allegheny City, Pennsylvania,
where he had to wear a brilliant stud
to light him on his way through the
streets, which are so dark and sooty that
an ordinary search-light would not suffice.
In his leisure hours, however, he lived at
the Hotel Walledup-Hysteria, in New York,
where he likewise had to wear the same
diamond stud to keep him from being a
marked man. Have you ever visited New
York, Watson?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when you do, spend a little of
your time at the Walledup-Hysteria. It
is a hotel with a population larger than
that of most cities, with streets running
to and from all points of the compass;
where men and women eat under conditions
that Lucullus knew nothing of;
where there is a carpeted boulevard on
which walk all sorts and conditions of
men; where one pays one&rsquo;s bill to the
dulcet strains of a string orchestra that
woo him into a blissful forgetfulness of
its size; and where, by pressing a button
in the wall, you may summon a grand
opera, or a porter who on request will
lend you enough money to enable you and
your family to live the balance of your
days in comfort. In America men have
been known to toil for years to amass a
fortune for the one cherished object of
spending a week in this Olympian spot,
and then to be content to return to their
toil and begin life anew, rich only in the
memory of its luxuries. It was here that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
I spent my time when, some years ago,
I went to the United States to solve the
now famous Piano Case. You will remember
how sneak thieves stole a grand piano
from the residence of one of New York&rsquo;s
first families, while the family was dining
in the adjoining room. While in the city,
and indeed at the very hotel in which I
stopped, and which I have described, Pinkham&rsquo;s
diamond stud disappeared, and, hearing
that I was a guest at the Walledup-Hysteria,
the owner appealed to me to
recover it for him. I immediately took
the case in hand. Drastic questioning of
Pinkham showed that beyond all question
he had lost the stud in his own apartment.
He had gone down to dinner, leaving it
on the centre-table, following the usual
course of most millionaires, to whom diamonds
are of no particular importance.
Pinkham wanted this one only because of
its associations. Its value, $80,000, was
a mere bagatelle in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now of course, if he positively left it
on the table, it must have been taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
by some one who had entered the room.
Investigation proved that the maid, a valet,
a fellow-millionaire from Chicago, and
Pinkham&rsquo;s children had been the only ones
to do this. The maid and the valet were
above suspicion. Their fees from guests
were large enough to place them beyond
the reach of temptation. I questioned
them closely, and they convinced me at
once of their innocence by conducting me
through the apartments of other guests
wherein tiaras of diamonds and necklaces
of pearls&mdash;ropes in very truth&mdash;rubies,
turquoise, and emerald ornaments of priceless
value, were scattered about in reckless
profusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;D&rsquo; yez t&rsquo;ink oi&rsquo;d waste me toime on
an eighty-t&rsquo;ousand-dollar shtood, wid all
dhis in soight and moine for the thrubble
uv swipin&rsquo; ut?&rdquo; said the French maid.</p>

<span class="caption">HOLMES IN DISGUISE INTERVIEWS WATTLES</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I acquitted her at once, and the valet
similarly proved his innocence, only with
less of an accent, for he was supposed to
be English, and not French, as was the
maid, although they both came from Dublin.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
This narrowed the suspects down to
Mr. Jedediah Wattles, of Chicago, and
the children. Naturally I turned my attention
to Wattles. A six-year-old boy
and a four-year-old girl could hardly be
suspected of stealing a diamond stud. So
drawing on Pinkham for five thousand
dollars to pay expenses, I hired a room in
a tenement-house in Rivington Street&mdash;a
squalid place it was&mdash;disguised myself
with an oily, black, burglarious mustache,
and dressed like a comic-paper gambler.
Then I wrote a note to Wattles, asking
him to call, saying that I could tell him
something to his advantage. He came,
and I greeted him like a pal. &lsquo;Wattles,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been working this game for
a long time, and I know all about you.
You are an ornament to the profession,
but we diamond-thieves have got to combine.
Understand?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
a man of good appearance, and I ain&rsquo;t,
but I know where the diamonds are. If
we work together, there&rsquo;s millions in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll spot the diamonds, and you lift &rsquo;em,
eh? You can do it,&rsquo; I added, as he began
to get mad. &lsquo;The ease with which you
got away with old Pinky&rsquo;s stud, that I&rsquo;ve
been trying to pull for myself for years,
shows me that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not allowed to go further. Wattles&rsquo;s
indignation was great enough to
prove that it was not he who had done
the deed, and after he had thrashed me
out of my disguise, I pulled myself together
and said, &lsquo;Mr. Wattles, I am convinced
that you are innocent.&rsquo; As soon
as he recognized me and realized my object
in sending for him, he forgave me, and, I
must say, treated me with great consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my last clew was gone. The
maid, the valet, and Wattles were proved
innocent. The children alone remained,
but I could not suspect them. Nevertheless,
on my way back to the hotel I bought
some rock-candy, and, after reporting to
Pinkham, I asked casually after the children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re pretty well,&rsquo; said Pinkham.
&lsquo;Billie&rsquo;s complaining a little, and the
doctor fears appendicitis, but Polly&rsquo;s all
right. I guess Billie&rsquo;s all right too. The
seventeen-course dinners they serve in the
children&rsquo;s dining-room here aren&rsquo;t calculated
to agree with Billie&rsquo;s digestion, I
reckon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to see &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
very fond of children.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pinkham immediately called the
youngsters in from the nursery. &lsquo;Guess
what I&rsquo;ve got,&rsquo; I said, opening the package
of rock-candy. &lsquo;Gee!&rsquo; cried Billie,
as it caught his eye. &lsquo;Gimme some!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Who gets first piece?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Me!&rsquo;
cried both. &lsquo;Anybody ever had any before?&rsquo;
I asked. &lsquo;He has,&rsquo; said Polly,
pointing to Billie. The boy immediately
flushed up. &lsquo;&rsquo;Ain&rsquo;t, neither!&rsquo; he retorted.
&lsquo;Yes you did, too,&rsquo; said Polly. &lsquo;<i>You swallered
that piece pop left on the centre-table
the other night!</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, anyhow, it was
only a little piece,&rsquo; said Billie. &lsquo;An&rsquo; it
tasted like glass,&rsquo; he added. Handing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
candy to Polly, I picked Billie up and
carried him to his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Pinkham,&rsquo; said I, handing the
boy over, &lsquo;here is your diamond. It has
not been stolen; it has merely been swallowed.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What?&rsquo; he cried. And I explained.
The stud mystery was explained. Mr.
Pinkham&rsquo;s boy had eaten it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holmes paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how that proves your
point,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You said that it was the
little things that told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;If Polly
hadn&rsquo;t told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s on me, old
man. We will go down to Willis&rsquo;s and
have some Russian caviare and a bottle
of Burgundy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holmes put on his hat and we went out
together. It is to get the money to pay
Willis&rsquo;s bill that I have written this story
of &ldquo;The Mystery of Pinkham&rsquo;s Diamond
Stud.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LANG TAMMAS AND DRUMSHEUGH SWEAR
OFF</h3>


<p class="center"><i>A tale of dialect told by Mr. Berkeley Hights, holder
of the twelfth ball</i></p>


<p>&ldquo;Hoot mon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words rang out derisively on the
cold frosty air of Drumtochty, as Lang
Tammas walked slowly along the street,
looking for the residence of Drumsheugh.
The effect was electrical. Tammas stopped
short, and turning about, scanned the
street eagerly to see who it was that had
spoken. But the highway was deserted,
and the old man shook his stick, as if at
an imaginary foe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hoot-mon the dour eediot that&rsquo;s
eensoolted a veesitor to Drumtochty!&rdquo; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
shouted. &ldquo;I haena brought me faithfu&rsquo;
steck for naething!&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>He glared about, now at this closed
window, now at that, as if inviting his
enemy to come forth and be punished, but
seeing no signs of life, turned again to
resume his walk, muttering angrily to
himself. It was indeed hardly to be
tolerated that he, one of the great characters
of fiction, should be thus jeered at,
as he thought, while on a friendly pilgrimage
from Thrums to Drumtochty, the
two rival towns in the affections of the
consumers of modern letters; and having
walked all the way from his home at
Thrums, Lang Tammas was tired, and
therefore in no mood to accept even a
mild affront, much less an insult.</p>

<p>He had scarcely covered ten paces, however,
when the same voice, with a harsh
cackling laugh, again broke the stillness
of the street:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gang awa&rsquo;, gang awa&rsquo;&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tammas rushed into the middle of the
way and picked up a stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;HOOT MON!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pit your bogie pate oot o&rsquo; your weendow,
me gillie!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gie it a
garry crack. Pit it oot, I say! Pit it
oot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the old man drew himself back
into an attitude which would have defied
the powers of Phidias to reproduce in
marble, the stone poised accurately and
all too ready to be hurled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye ramshackle macloonatic!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Standin&rsquo; in a weendow, where nane may
see, an&rsquo; heepin&rsquo; eensoolts on deecint fowk.
Pit it oot&mdash;pit it oot&mdash;an&rsquo; get it crackit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reply was instant:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gang awa&rsquo;, gang awa&rsquo;&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had Lang Tammas been a creation of
Lever, he would at this point have removed
his coat and his hat and thrown them
down violently to earth, and then have
whacked the walk three times with the
stout stick he carried in his right hand, as
a preliminary to the challenge which followed.
But Tammas was not Irish, and
therefore not impulsive. He was Scotch&mdash;as
Scotch as ever was. Wherefore he removed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
his hat, and, after dusting it carefully,
hung it up on a convenient hook;
took off his coat and folded it neatly;
picked up his &ldquo;faithfu&rsquo; steck,&rdquo; and observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hae naething to do that&rsquo;s of eemportance.
Drumsheugh can wait, an&rsquo; sae can
ee. Pit it oot, pit it oot! Here I am,
an&rsquo; here I stay until ye pit it oot to be
crackit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gang awa&rsquo;, gang awa&rsquo;&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
came the reply.</p>

<p>Lang Tammas turned on the instant to
the sources of the sound. He fixed his
eyes sternly on the very window whence
he thought the words had issued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number twanty-three, saxth floor,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself. &ldquo;I will call, and
then we shall see what we <i>shall</i> see; and
if what we see gets off wi&rsquo;oot a thorough
&lsquo;hootin&rsquo;,&rsquo; then I dinna ken me beezniss.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;A SWEET-FACED NURSE APPEARED&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Hastily discarding his outward wrath,
and assuming such portions of his garments
as went with his society manner,
Tammas walked into the lobby of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
apartment-house in which his assumed insulter
lived. He pushed the electric button
in, and shortly a sweet-faced nurse
appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said Lang Tammas, somewhat
abashed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve called too see the head o&rsquo;
the hoose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the trained nurse,
bursting into tears, &ldquo;but the head of the
house is at the point of death, sir, and cannot
see you until to-morrow. Call around
about ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoots an&rsquo; toots!&rdquo; sighed Lang Tammas.
&ldquo;Canna we Scuts have e&rsquo;er a story
wi&rsquo;oot somebody leein&rsquo; at the point o&rsquo;
death! It&rsquo;s most affectin&rsquo;, but doonricht
wearin&rsquo; on the constitootion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there anything you wished to say
to him?&rdquo; asked the nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, aye!&rdquo; returned Lang Tammas.
&ldquo;I dinna ken hoo to deny that I hed that
to say to him, an&rsquo; to do to him as weel.
I&rsquo;m a vairy truthfu&rsquo; mon, young lady, an&rsquo;
if ye must be told, I&rsquo;ve called to wring his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
garry neck for dereesively gee&rsquo;in an unoffending
veesitor frae Thrums by yelling
deealect at him frae the hoose-tops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it was here?&rdquo; asked the
nurse, anxiously, the old gentleman seemed
so deeply in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure? Oh, aye&mdash;pairfectly,&rdquo; replied
Lang Tammas; but even as he spoke, the
falsity of his impression was proved by the
same strident voice that had so offended
before, coming from the other side of the
street:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a crittur ye are, ye cow! What
a crittur ye are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soonds are hard to place, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Lang Tammas, jerking about as if he had
been shot. It was a very hard position for
the old man, for, with the immediate need
for an apology to the nurse, there rushed
over him an overwhelming wave of anger.
Hitherto it was merely a suspicion that he
was being made sport of that had irritated
him, but this last outburst&mdash;&ldquo;What a crittur
ye are, ye cow!&rdquo;&mdash;was convincing evidence
that it was to him that the insults<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
were addressed; for in Thrums it is history
that Hendry and T&rsquo;nowhead and
Jim McTaggart frequently greeted Lang
Tammas&rsquo;s jokes with &ldquo;Oh, ye cow!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;What a crittur ye are!&rdquo; But the old
man was equal to the emergency, and fixing
one eye upon the house opposite and
the other upon the sweet-faced nurse, he
darted glances that should kill at his persecutor,
and at the same time apologized
for disturbing the nurse. The latter he
did gracefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye look aweary, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; if the head o&rsquo; the hoose maun dee,
may he dee immejiately, that ye may rest
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with this, pulling his hat down
over his forehead viciously, he turned and
sped swiftly across the way. The nurse
gazed anxiously after him, and in her secret
soul wondered if she would not better
send for Jamie McQueen, the town constable.
Poor Tammas&rsquo;s eye was really so
glaring, and his whole manner so manifestly
that of a man exasperated to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
verge of madness, that she considered
him somewhat in the light of a menace
to the public safety. She was not at all
reassured, either, when Tammas, having
reached the other side of the street, began
gesticulating wildly, shaking his &ldquo;faithfu&rsquo;
steck&rdquo; at the fa&ccedil;ade of the confronting
flat-house. But an immediate realization
of the condition of the sick man
above led her to forego the attempt to
protect the public safety, and closing the
door softly to, she climbed the weary
stairs to the sixth floor, and soon forgot
the disturbing trial of the morning in
reading to her patient certain inspiring
chapters from the Badminton edition of
<i>Haggert&rsquo;s Chase of Heretics</i>, relieved with
the lighter <i>Rules of Golf; or, Auld Putt
Idylls</i>, by the Rev. Ian McCrockett, one
of the most exquisitely confusing humorous
works ever published in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Lang Tammas meanwhile was addressing
an invisible somebody in the building
over the way, and in no uncertain tones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were not a geentlemon and a humorist,&rdquo;
he said, impressively, agitating
his stick nervously at the building front,
&ldquo;I could say much that nae Scut may say.
But were I nae Scut, I&rsquo;d say this to ye:
&lsquo;Ye have all the eelements of a confairmed
heeritic. Ye&rsquo;ve nae sense of deecint fun.
Ye&rsquo;re not a man for a&rsquo; that, as most men
air&mdash;ye&rsquo;re an ass, plain and simple, wi&rsquo;
naether the plainness nor the simpleecity
o&rsquo; the individual that Balaam rode.
Further&mdash;more&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Lang Tammas would have said
furthermore had he not been a Scot the
world will never know, for from the other
side of the street&mdash;farther along, however&mdash;came
the squawking voice again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gang awa&rsquo;, gang awa&rsquo;, ye crittur, ye
cow! Hoot mon&mdash;hoot mon&mdash;hoot mon!
Gang awa&rsquo;, gang awa&rsquo;!&rdquo; And this was
followed by a raucous cry, which might
or might not have been Scottish, but
which was, in any event, distinctly maddening.
And even as the previous insults
had electrified poor Tammas, so this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
last petrified him, and he stood for an appreciable
length of time absolutely transfixed.
His mind was a curious study.
His coming had been prompted entirely
by the genial spirit which throbbed beneath
his stony Scottish exterior. For a
long time he had been a resident of the
most conspicuous Scotch town in all literature,
and he was himself its accepted
humorist. Then on a sudden Thrums
had a rival. Drumtochty sprang forth,
and in the matter of pathos, if not humor,
ran Thrums hard; and Lang Tammas,
attracted to Drumsheugh, had come this
distance merely to pay his respects, and
to see what manner of man the real
Drumsheugh was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<span class="caption">TAMMAS MEETS DRUMSHAUGH</span>
</div>

<p>And this was his reception! To be
laughed at&mdash;he, a Scotch humorist! Had
any one ever laughed at a Scotch humorist
before? Never. Was not the test of humor
in Scotland the failure to laugh of
the hearer of the jest? Would Scotch
humor ever prove great if not taken seriously?
Oh, aye! Hendry never laughed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
at his jokes, and Hendry knew a joke when
he saw one. McTaggart never smiled at
Lang Tammas; and as for the little Minister&mdash;he
knew what was due to the humorist
of Thrums, as well as to himself, and
enjoyed the exquisite humor of Tammas
with a reserve well qualified to please the
Presbytery and the Congregation.</p>

<p>How long Lang Tammas would have
stood petrified no man may say; but just
then who should come along but the person
he had come to call upon&mdash;Drumsheugh
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Knox et pr&aelig;terea nihil!</i>&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;What in Glasgie hae we
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lang Tammas turned upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye hae nowt in Glasgie here,&rdquo; he said,
sternly. &ldquo;Ye hae a vairy muckle pit-oot
veesitor, wha hae coom on an airand o&rsquo;
good-will to be gret wi&rsquo; eensoolts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eensoolts?&rdquo; retorted Drumsheugh.
&ldquo;Eensoolts, ye say? An&rsquo; wha hae bin
eensooltin&rsquo; ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I know nowt of, save that he be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a doonricht foo&rsquo; a-heepin&rsquo; his deealect
upon me head,&rdquo; said Lang Tammas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wha are ye to be so seensitive o&rsquo;
deealect?&rdquo; demanded Drumsheugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Lang Tammas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; Thrums?&rdquo; cried Drumsheugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nane ither,&rdquo; said Tammas.</p>

<p>Drumsheugh burst into an uproarious
fit of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The humorist?&rdquo; he cried, catching
his sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nane ither,&rdquo; said Tammas, gravely.
&ldquo;And wha are ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Oh, I&rsquo;m&mdash;Drumsheugh o&rsquo; Drumtochty,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Come along hame
wi&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;ll gie ye that to make the eensoolt
seem a compliment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the two old men walked off together.</p>

<p>An hour later, on their way to the kirk,
Drumsheugh observed that after the service
was over he would go with Lang
Tammas and seek out the man who had
insulted him and &ldquo;gie&rdquo; him a drubbing,
which invitation Tammas was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
loath to accept. Reverently the two new-made
friends walked into the kirk and
sat themselves down on the side aisle. A
hymn was sung, and the minister was
about to read from the book, when the
silence of the church was broken by a
shrill voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoot mon! Hoot mon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tammas clutched his stick. The voice
was the same, and here it had penetrated
the sacred precincts of the church! Nowhere
was he safe from insult. Drumsheugh
looked up, startled, and the voice
began again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gang awa&rsquo; a-that, a-that, a-that&mdash;gang
awa&rsquo;! Oh, ye crittur! oh, ye cow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then a titter ran through that
solemn crowd; for, despite the gravity of
the situation, even John Knox himself
must have smiled. A great green parrot
had flown in at one of the windows, and
had perched himself on the pulpit, where,
with front undismayed, he addressed the
minister:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gang awa&rsquo;, gang awa&rsquo;!&rdquo; he cried, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
preened himself. &ldquo;Hoot mon, gang
awa&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Knox nobiscum!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Drumsheugh.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Moggie McPiggert&rsquo;s pairrut,&rdquo;
and he chuckled; and then, as Lang
Tammas realized the situation, even he
smiled broadly. He had been insulted by
a parrot only, and the knowledge of it
made him feel better.</p>

<p>The bird was removed and the service
proceeded; and later, when it was over,
as the two old fellows walked back to
Drumsheugh&rsquo;s house in the gathering
shades of the night, Lang Tammas said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I acquet Drumtochty o&rsquo; its eensoolts,
Drumsheugh, but I&rsquo;ve lairnt a lesson this
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Drumsheugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When pairruts speak Scutch deealect,
it&rsquo;s time we Scuts gae it oop,&rdquo; said Tammas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo; agreed Drumsheugh.
&ldquo;But hoo express our thochts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dinna ken for ye,&rdquo; said Lang Tammas,
&ldquo;but for me, mee speakee heathen
Chinee this timee on.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Vairy weel,&rdquo; returned Drumsheugh.
&ldquo;Vairy weel; I dinna ken heathen Chinee,
but I hae some acqueentance wi&rsquo; the tongue
o&rsquo; sairtain Amairicans, and that I&rsquo;ll speak
from this day on&mdash;it&rsquo;s vairy weel called
the Bowery eediom, and is a judeecious
mixture o&rsquo; English, Irish, and Volapeck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from that time on Lang Tammas
and Drumsheugh spoke never another
word of Scotch dialect; and while Tammas
never quite mastered pidgin-English,
or Drumsheugh the tongue of Fadden,
they lived happily ever after, which in a
way proves that, after all, the parrot is a
useful as well as an ornamental bird.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION&mdash;LIKEWISE MR. BILLY
JONES</h3>


<p>The cheers which followed the narration
of the curious resolve of Lang Tammas
and Drumsheugh were vociferous,
and Berkeley Hights sat down with a
flush of pleasure on his face. He construed
these as directed towards himself
and his contribution to the diversion of
the evening. It never entered into his
mind that the applause involved a bit of
subtle appreciation of the kindness of
Tammas and of Drumsheugh to the reading
public in thus declining to give them
more of something of which they had
already had enough.</p>

<p>When the cheers had subsided Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Jones rose from his chair and congratulated
the club upon its exhibit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you have but faintly re-echoed
the weaknesses of the strong,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you have done well, and I congratulate
you. It is not every man in your walk in
life who can write as grammatically as you
have dreamed. I have failed to detect in
any one of the stories or poems thus far
read a single grammatical error, and I
have no doubt that the manuscripts that
you have read from are gratifyingly free
from mistakes in spelling as well, so that,
from a newspaper man&rsquo;s stand-point, I see
no reason why you should not get these
proceedings published, especially if you
do it at your own expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now declare The Dreamers adjourned
<i>sine die</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; cried the members, unanimously.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your contribution?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out with it, William!&rdquo; shouted Tom
Snobbe. &ldquo;I can tell by the set of your
coat that you&rsquo;ve got a manuscript concealed in
your pocket.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing ruins the set of a
coat more quickly than a rejected manuscript
in the pocket,&rdquo; put in Hudson Rivers.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there myself&mdash;so, as
Lang Tammas said, Billy, &lsquo;Pit it oot, and
get it crackit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jones replied, with a pleased
smile, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, gentlemen,
I had come prepared in case I was called
upon; but the hour is late,&rdquo; he added,
after the manner of one who, though willing,
enjoyed being persuaded. &ldquo;Perhaps
we had better postpone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out with it, old man. It is late, but
it will be later still if you don&rsquo;t hurry up
and begin,&rdquo; said Tenafly Paterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, here goes,&rdquo; said Jones.
&ldquo;Mine is a ghost-story, gentlemen, and it
is called &lsquo;The Involvular Club; or, The
Return of the Screw.&rsquo; It is, like the rest
of the work this evening, imitative, after a
fashion, but I think it will prove effective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones hereupon took the manuscript
from his bulging pocket and read
as follows:</p>

<h4>THE INVOLVULAR CLUB; OR, THE RETURN
OF THE SCREW</h4>

<p>The story had taken hold upon us as we
sat round the blazing hearth of Lord Ormont&rsquo;s
smoking-room, at Castle Aminta,
and sufficiently interfered with our comfort,
as indeed from various points of
view, not to specify any one of the many,
for they were, after all, in spite of their
diversity, of equal value judged by any
standard, not even excepting the highest,
that of Vereker&rsquo;s disturbing narrative of
the uncanny visitor to his chambers, which
the reader may recall&mdash;indeed, must recall
if he ever read it, since it was the
most remarkable ghost-story of the year&mdash;a
year in which many ghost-stories of
wonderful merit, too, were written&mdash;and
by which his reputation was made&mdash;or
rather extended, for there were a certain
few of us, including Feverel and Vanderbank
and myself, who had for many years
known him as a constant&mdash;almost too constant,
some of us ventured, tentatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
perhaps, but not the less convincedly, to
say&mdash;producer of work of a very high
order of excellence, rivalling in some of
its more conspicuous elements, as well as
in its minor, to lay no stress upon his
subtleties, which were marked, though at
times indiscreetly inevident even to the
keenly analytical, hinging as these did
more often than not upon abstractions
born only of a circumscribed environment&mdash;circumscribed,
of course, in the larger
sense which means the narrowing of a circle
of appreciation down to the select few
constituting its essence&mdash;the productions
of the greatest masters of fictional style
the world has known, or is likely, in view
of present tendencies towards miscalled
romance, which consists solely of depicting
scenes in which bloodshed and murder
are rife, soon to know again&mdash;it was
proper it should, in a company chosen as
ours had been from among the members
of The Involvular Club, with Adrian Feverel
at its head, Vereker as its vice-president,
and Lord Ormont, myself, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
number of ladies, including Diana of the
Crossways, and little Maisie&mdash;for the child
was one of our cares, her estate was so
pitiable a one&mdash;Rhoda Fleming, Daisy
Miller, and Princess Cassimassima, one
and all, as the reader must be aware, personages&mdash;if
I may thus refer to a group
of appreciation which included myself&mdash;who
knew a good thing when they saw it,
which, it may as well be confessed at
once, we rarely did in the raucous fields
of fiction outside of, though possibly at
times moderately contiguous to, our own
territory, although it should be said that
Miss Miller occasionally manifested a
lamentable lack of regard for the objects
for which The Involvular was formed, by
showing herself, in her semi-American
way, regrettably direct of speech and given
over not infrequently to an unhappy
use of slang, which we all, save Maisie,
who was young, and, in spite of all she
knew, not quite so knowledgeable a young
person as some superficial observers have
chosen to believe, sincerely deprecated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and on occasion when it might be done
tactfully, endeavored to mitigate by a reproving
glance, or by a still deeper plunge
into nebulous rhetoric, as a sort of palliation
to the Muse of Obscurity, which in
our hearts we felt that good goddess
would accept, strove to offset.</p>

<p>[&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr. Tom Snobbe,
rising and interrupting the reader at this
point, &ldquo;but is that all one sentence, Mr.
Jones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jones replied. &ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s
perfectly clear in its meaning. Aren&rsquo;t you
used to long sentences on the Hudson?&rdquo;
he added, sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Snobbe; &ldquo;that is to
say, not where I live. I believe they have
&rsquo;em at Sing Sing occasionally. But they
never get used to them, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Tom,&rdquo; said Harry Snobbe.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad form to interrupt. Let Billy
finish his story.&rdquo; Mr. Jones then resumed
his manuscript.]</p>

<p>A perceptible shudder ran through, or
rather rolled over, the group, for it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
corrugating in its quality, bringing forcibly
to mind, quite as much for its chill,
too, as for the wrinkling suggestion of its
passage up and down our backs, turned as
some of these were towards the fire, and
others towards the steam-radiator, which
now and again clicked startlingly in the
dull red glow of the hearth light, augmenting
the all too obvious nervousness
of the listeners, the impassive and uninspiring
squares of iron of which certain
modern architects of a limited decorative
sense&mdash;if, indeed, they have any at all, for
the mere use of corrugated iron in the
construction of a fa&ccedil;ade would seem not
to admit of an &aelig;sthetic side to its designer&rsquo;s
nature, however ornately distributed
over the surface of an exterior it may
be&mdash;have chosen to avail themselves,
prompted either by an appalling parsimony
on the part of a client, or for
reasons of haste employed for the lack
of more immediately available material, it
being an undeniable fact that in some
portions of the world stucco and terracotta,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
now frequently used in lieu of more
substantial, if not more enduring materials,
are difficult of access, and the use
of a speedily obtainable substitute becoming
thus a requirement as inevitable as it
is to be regretted, as in the case of the
fruit-market at Venice, standing as it does
on the bank of the Grand Canal, a pile of
stark, staring, obtrusive, wrinkling zinc
thrusting itself brazenly into the line of a
vision attuned to the most gloriously towering
palazzos, as rich in beauty as in
romance, with such self-sufficiency as to
bring tears to the eyes of the most stolidly
unappreciative, of the most coldly un&aelig;sthetic,
or, in short, as some one has chosen
to say, in an essay the title of which and
the name of whose author escape us at
this moment, with such complacent vulgarity
as to amount to nothing less than a
dastardly blot upon the escutcheon of
the Venetians, which all of their glorious
achievements in art, in history, and in
letters can never quite ineradically efface,
and alongside of which the whistling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
steam-tugs with their belching funnels,
which are by slow degrees supplanting
the romantic gondolier with his picturesque
costume and his tender songs of
sunny climes in the cab service of the
Bride of the Adriatic, seem quite excusable,
or, in any event, not so unforgivable
as to constitute what the Americans would
call an infernal shame.</p>

<p>[At this point the reader was interrupted
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Billy&mdash;will you,
please?&rdquo; said Tenafly Paterson. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get this story straight. As I understand
the first sentence somebody told a ghost-story,
didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jones, a trifle annoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the second sentence means that
those who heard it felt creepy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why the deuce couldn&rsquo;t you
have said, &lsquo;When So-and-So had finished,
the company shuddered&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Jones, &ldquo;I am reading
a story which is constructed after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
manner of a certain school. I&rsquo;m not reading
a postal-card or a cable message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader then resumed.]</p>

<p>Miss Miller, to relieve the strain upon
the nerves of those present, which was
becoming unbearably tense&mdash;and, in fact,
poor Maisie had burst into tears with the
sheer terror of the climax, and had been
taken off to be put to bed by Mrs. Brookenham,
who, in spite of many other qualities,
was still a womanly woman at heart,
and not wholly deficient in those little
tendernesses, those trifling but ineffable
softnesses of nature, which are at once the
chief source of woman&rsquo;s strength and of
her weakness, a fact she was constantly
manifesting to us during our stay at Lord
Ormont&rsquo;s, and which we all remarked and
in some cases commented upon, since the
discovery had in it some of the qualities
of a revelation&mdash;began to sing one of those
extraordinary popular songs that one hears
at the music-halls in London, and in the
politer and more refined circles of American
society, if indeed there may be said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
be such a thing in a land so new as to be
as yet mostly veneer, with little that is
solid in its social substructure, beginning
as its constituent factors do at the top
and working downward, rather than choosing
the more natural course of beginning
at the bottom and working upward, and
which must materially, one may think,
affect the social solidarity of the nation
by retarding its growth and in otherwise
interfering with its healthy, not to say
normal development, and which, as the
words and import of it come back to me,
was known by the rather vulgar and
vernacular title of &ldquo;All Coons Look Alike
to Me,&rdquo; thus indicating that the life treated
of in the melody, which was not altogether
unmusical, and was indeed as a matter of
fact quite fetching in its quality, running
in one&rsquo;s ears for days and nights long
after its first hearing, was that of the
negro, and his personal likeness to his
other black brethren in the eyes even of
one who was supposed to have been at
one time, prior to the action of the song<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
if not coincidently with it, the object of his
affections.</p>

<p>[Had Jones not been wholly absorbed
in the reading of this wonderful story, he
might at this moment have heard a slight
but unmistakable rumbling sound, and
have looked up and seen much that
would have interested him. But, as this
kind of a story requires for its complete
comprehension a complete concentration
of mind, he did not hear, and so, continuing,
did not see.]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<span class="caption">HE DID NOT SEE</span>
</div>

<p>Diana was the first to mitigate the
silence with comment [he read] a silence
whose depth had only been rendered the
more depressing by Miss Miller&rsquo;s uncalled-for
intrusion upon our mood of something
that smacked of a society towards which
most of us, in so far as we were able to do
so, had always cultivated a strenuous aloofness,
prompted not by any whelmful sense
of our own perfection, latent or obvious,
but rather by a realization on our part
that it lacked the essentials that could
make of it an interesting part of the lives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of a group given over wholly, or at least
as nearly wholly as the exiguities of existence
would permit of a persistent and
continuous devotion, to the contemplation
of the beautiful in art, letters, or any
other phase of human endeavor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did his soul never thaw?&rdquo; Diana
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Vanderbank, &ldquo;It is
frozen yet.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width:30%' />

<p>Here the rumbling sound grew to such
volume that, absorbed as he was in his
reading, Jones could no longer fail to hear
it. Lowering his manuscript, he looked
sternly upon the company. The rumbling
sound was a chorus, not unmusical,
of snores.</p>

<p><i>The Dreamers slept.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged!&rdquo; cried Jones, angrily,
and then he walked over and looked
behind the screen where the stenographer
was seated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish it if it takes all
night,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Just take this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
down,&rdquo; he added to the stenographer;
but that worthy never stirred or made
reply. <i>He too was sleeping.</i></p>

<p>Jones muttered angrily to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it to
myself, then,&rdquo; and he began again. For
ten minutes he continued, and then on a
sudden his voice faltered; his head fell
forward upon his chest, his knees collapsed
beneath him, and he slid inert, and snoring
himself, into his chair. The MS.
fluttered to the floor, and an hour later
the waiters entering the room found the
club unanimously engaged in dreaming
once more.</p>

<p>The Involvular Club was too much for
them, even for the author of it, but
whether this was because of the lateness
of the hour or because of the intricacies
of the author&rsquo;s style I have never been
able to ascertain, for Mr. Jones is very
sore on the point, and therefore reticent,
and as for the others, I cannot find that
any of them remember enough about it to
be able to speak intelligently on the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>All I do know is what the landlord tells
me, and that is that at 5 <small>A.M.</small> thirteen
cabs containing thirteen sleeping souls
pursued their thirteen devious ways to
thirteen different houses, thus indicating
that the Dreamers were ultimately adjourned,
and, as they have not met since,
I presume the adjournment was, as usual,
<i>sine die</i>.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
